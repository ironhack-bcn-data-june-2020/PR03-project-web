King's Cross Railway Station,"Euston Rd, Kings Cross, London N1 9AL","The station where Harry and his friends boarded the train to Hogwarts. Of course, platform 9 ¾ does not actually exist, and the filming was actually done between platforms 4 and 5, as the real platforms 9 and 10 are separated by tracks. The magical entrance to platform 9 ¾ has been recreated at the station entrance for fans to have their photos taken, but figure on spending at least 2 hours in the queue with throngs of other fans. A Harry Potter souvenir shop is also located in the station for fans to purchase memorabilia. The exterior shots in the film were not filmed using the real King's Cross Railway Station, but rather were filmed using the adjacent St Pancras Railway Station, which is far more elaborate and impressive than the relatively plain King's Cross."
