40,nice tapas and wine,"The place is cool and authentic decor ! Waiters are very nice and gave good tips to help you to choose your meal! Warning with the queue outside, you may wait for a while but it worth it ! typical spanish tapas and wine","Reviewed June 12, 2020",Date of visit: August 2019
50,Best tapas in Barcelona?,"If you’re in Barcelona, you’ll want to try some tapas. If you only have time to try tapas once, go here. We went on our first night of a five day trip and, although we had tapas elsewhere during our stay, this was the best. The premises are small, about 20 covers, and there’s no booking so you just have to turn up early. Fortunately we did. It’s cash only but for 40€ you can have the house selection for two – plentiful plates of delicious food (no fish or seafood) including Iberian ham and warm bread with tomato paste. Details like the warm bread – it’s often cold – mark this place down as the superior experience that it is. Our server, Kate, was delightful and helpful in equal measure. The wine list is short but appropriate. Highly recommended.Show less","Reviewed March 14, 2020",Date of visit: March 2020
50,Yummy tapas!,"We were looking for a different Bodega Biarritz, but ended up at this one. This location was able to seat our party of 3 whereas the other had at least a 20+ minute wait. The workers told us it's the same restaurant, just a different location. The food was amazing. We allowed them to select our tapas after they asked us a few questions. We asked for more meat than veggies. The veggie tapas had mushrooms and eggplant which my husband doesn't like so I ended up eating those tapas and they turned out to be really tasty. The meat ones were good, too. The jamon iberico appetizer was really good!! Our server was very attentive and checked in on us just enough. We definitely recommend this place.Show less","Reviewed March 8, 2020",Date of visit: February 2020

50,Best Tapas in Barcelona,It was super packed when my party of 3 arrived. David was fantastic from the start he got us drinks while we waited. Then he guided us in and advised us on the best possible dinner. This is definitely one of the best places in Barcelona to eat.

50,Recommend,"Before we entered the staff made sure we were aware that there was no seafood available and that they only accept cash in case this would cause any problems. I really like that they did this to make sure we don't run into this place with different expectations.We had a table pretty fast, the area is creatively designed with a Spanish esthetic. It's a very warm environment (not as in heat but as in cosy.) We picked menu option two. In this option they picked out the tapas for you. (there's an option to pick your own or send back ones you didn't like and get them replaced)The food was very tasty and fast at our table. The tapas were diverse so the flavor pallette wouldn't get boring.The staff is incredible. They made the place feel like home in a way (homey) .

Thankfully we arrived at 645pm and managed to get a table as soon after it was full and people were queuing outside. It’s not a big place..We went for the €40/2 people tapas menu and a lovely bottle of Cataluynan red (Terra). Our server Oliver was awesome. He asked for our eating preferences then chose tapas for us. 8 courses plus pre-appetiser.

50,Favourite restaurant in Spain!,"My partner and I visited here last June, out of all the places we visited on our 2 week trip (Barcelona, Seville,Madrid) this was our favourite restaurant! We even came back for dinner a second time! Very busy, small, but a great atmosphere, and customer service-I'll get to the amazing food later. If you get there at rush hour and have to wait in a que they have little stools lined up for you to sit on, and they come and take your drinks order while you wait.My partner is vegetarian and lactose intolerant- we took a gamble and went for the surprise order (a starter, and 8 tapas) we explained my partners eating requirements and they went above and beyond, the chef even came out to double check what he could and couldn't eat (very reassuring when you have someone with intolerances/allergies). I think he took it as a personal challenge to make us something special. The food was AMAZING! During our 2nd visit we were expecting to have the same dishes as the first time (there's only so much you can do with certain requirements) but they still managed to give us new and different dishes. Each time we had 2 of the tapas dishes as meat (for me), which were equally nice.100% recommend as a MUST if your visiting Barcelona!

50,The most exclusive and BEST place in Barcelona,"We found this restaurant via TripAdvisor.Please note this is a very small restaurant and you are not able to book. So I would definitely advise large groups to avoid. However I felt this led to its exclusivity.We let our Waitress Jennifer make the decisions/recommendations for the entire meal following a friendly conversation regarding our preferences. She could not have been more hospitable and her choices were amazing.We have had tapas in many restaurants - in both UK & Barcelona - and this was by far the best food.It was worth it for the original & personal experience alone.Oh, and the bill was ridiculously cheap (I had genuinely thought they had only charged us for 1 person instead of 2!)The ONLY thing that would make this place perfect is if they took card payments.Show less","Reviewed January 21, 2020",Date of visit: January 2020

They even told us if we didn't like one of the tapas then no problem! They would switch it up. We did not end up doing this because they were all quite tasty.

50,Fantastic Food at a Reasonable Price,"Being the number one restaurant on TripAdvisor and finding this place somewhat on a whim, I doubted that we would get a seat. Luckily enough, the line wasn't too long (roughly 15 minutes) and the seating was efficient, if not slightly too intimate.We ordered the tasting menu, which was 1 appetizer (mushroom croquettes) and 8 tapas. Each dish was simply incredible. Consisting of mostly vegetarian dishes (e.g., egg quiche) and chicken/ chorizo dishes (e.g., patatas bravas), the food had a felt largely like homemade comfort food with bright flavor profiles in the individual ingredients. It's hard to pick a standout, but the chorizo sausage in particular was absolutely divine. This certainly tops my list for best tapas I've had in Barcelona.In combination with two large sangria cup (7 euros each) and 30 euros for the tasting menu, the bill came out to an incredibly affordable 44 euros for TWO. Cesar, our waitstaff, was expedient and kind throughout and even gifted us with four extra shots at the bar.

No seafood and no fishThey offer a set menu (2 versions), but unless you’re going to have your full meal here I would opt out and choose your own 3 tapas to share between 2 people; this is what we did. Saved us some money so we could try other places the same night.Very quaint and tight knit restaurant. We arrived around 8 pm and had 3 couples in front of us so we waited with a glass of wine in hand. Great casual date night ambience. Dark with low lighting. The staff is super knowledgeable and friendly, and gave us a tapas-by-tapas explanation of what they are before we chose what we wanted. They are categorized sections. You choose your tapas and they will reheat/cook it for you as you wait.Food: We started with their complimentary potato dish, then moved on to the ham and cheese pastry, which had a nice sharp manchego dominant flavor (in a good way!)The star of the night for us were the last 2 tapas we chose. The “FLAN” BROCCOLI dish topped with bubbly goat cheese was light, different, and delicious!! And the “FLAN” of MUSHROOM was full-flavored.. we could’ve easily taken down 4 more.. both were 3 Euros each.Show less","Reviewed November 30, 2019",Date of visit: November 2019

One of the tapas was not to our taste (egg plant based), so we asked to change and the waiter changed without problem!

It is very tight for room and we were on a small table against the wall. There are 3 meal options on the menu with 1 and 2 being different options where they pick for you and option 3 being you pick yourself from the tapas which is sat st the bar. We chose option 2. We were asked a few questions about what we liked and then left it up to the staff.We had two appetizers and a board of bread, cheese and ham. All delicious. While waiting for our tapas we were offered a more comfortable table when it had become available and I noticed that happen a couple of times when we were there which I thought was a nice gesture.We were then served our tapas selection all of which we loved but if you dont like something they will happily change it. We finished with a coffee liquor shot which considering I dont usually like that kind of thing was quite nice. On leaving the staff shook our hand, thanked us for coming and were just really friendly and helpful the whole time we were there. One thing to note is they only take cash but we were told this before we went in and there was a sign outside.

However, we were served a spectacular tapas dinner and also had a very good time while we were there.We had the ""Menu Surprise Ibérico"" for two and we loved (and finished) almost everything in it, even though it was quite a lot of food. We also shared a bottle of wine which was very nicely priced. The service was also very good and added to the whole experience.The atmosphere at the place was tremendeous. Small and narrow, but not cramped. Everybody seemed to enjoy their meals and had a good time. Definately worth another visit next time we come to Barcelona.Show less","Reviewed September 23, 2019",Date of visit: September 2019

Ushered in by a grumpy Asian guy after being kept at the door while restaurant was empty, we were then told they only accepted cash. And that they did not have wifi.The food was greasy, uninspiring and actually the worst meal I’ve had so far after a week in Spain. They also have a policy to not allow customers to have a drink after dinner if there is a queue.Just a money grabbing unhappy experience and my biggest regret was that we didn’t leave.They offered us the 15 euro package each which they said was great value but there was not one single piece of seafood in the 8 pintxos they served us for 30 euros.Avoid at all costsShow less","Reviewed September 17, 2019",Date of visit: September 2019

The place is pretty well hidden, but we managed to find it eventually. Waited in a queue for 30 minutes to be seated; we thought about leaving but were too hungry to even think about going to another restaurant. We were seated at the smallest table in the world, a table on the wall approx 30 cm wide. Everyone kept bumping into me while passing by and I could barely use my knife and fork on that tiny shelf (table).Although they serve tapas, the place had a french vibe to it, which I enjoyed, but I didn’t get why other reviewers saw this place as authentic Catalan...Food was good, tasty, vegetables were perfectly cooked. The chorizo and patatas bravas were good.Prices Look ok at first glance, but it’s not cheap. €3-4 for each small tapas portion. Ended up paying €36 for 6 tapas a sangria and a bottle of water. Quite a lot considering that the previous night we payed €44 for a 2 course meal for 2 in a proper restaurant (Senyor Parellada, it’s on the Michelin guide)All in all it was an interesting experience, but I think everyone is over exaggerating with the reviews.

It’s a pretty unique menu concept, with only 2 choices really as far as I could tell (honestly not positive about this), but basically you tell them what you don’t like to eat and they just start rapid firing out the most tasty damn tapas you’ve ever had. The food was great no doubt, but our pal Oliver made experience unforgettable. He made us feel so welcome and was really helpful in explaining some of the dishes to us. Here is a tip we got that o can verify is 100% true: get there before 7 or risk waiting in a line for awhile. This place is an experience and not just a spot for a quick meal.

While we waited outside for a table we ordered strawberry mojitos that were really well made and delicous. We didn't know what we were looking at on the menu and then Oliver came to the rescue! He took great care of us and suggested we order the #2 which is a variety of different tapas that came out at different times. Come hungry to this place, it was a great variety of food and everything that came out tasted great. Also, the atmosphere at this place is so awesome. It has this well kept, intimate, cozy, dive bar feeling with killer food and a wonderful staff.

50,Absolute Best Tapas Bar!,"We couldn’t ask for a better and more perfect place for tapas! My wife and I were in Barcelona for the first time and for only one night. We wanted to find a nice but casual place for tapas and drinks and this place was exactly what we were looking for.We did the menu where they pick which food to bring out based on some preferences and it was amazing. Also very inexpensive. We walked out full and each had a couple house mojitos too for only 50 euros. Not gonna get that anywhere at a nice place in the states. Very personable staff and great atmosphere.As a comparison, we tried another place for lunch the next day and it wasn’t even close to same quality in food, service, experience, vibe.

There were three of us, and the friendly staff helped choose the different tapas that we should eat. They asked questions about our tastes concerning meats and different vegetables, and as they served each tapa, they explained more about what we were eating. We don't drink beer, but they had great cokes with ice, and the food was super with much variety and flavor. We decided it was our best meal in Barcelona.

50,Best meal in Spain!,"Favorite restaurant in Barcelona! Found this restaurant on TripAdvisor while looking for a good tapas place and trust all the reviews it is AMAZING! We went at around 930pm and it there was a wait we waited for about 25-30 minutes but you can buy drinks while you wait and drink them outside. The place inside is TINY, the tables could barely fit one plate so if there is space at the bar definitely suggest sitting there instead. You can either buy tapas or you can pick from their “prefix menu” which is what we did. You get 8 tapas to share but they pick for you, you just tell them any allergies and what you don’t like. At first I was a little intimidated by this idea of letting other people chose food for me but the cool thing about this place is if you don’t like a plate you can send it back and they will exchange it for you! The food was INCREDIBLE the best meal I had in Spain and the service was OUTSTANDING! Oliver was such a great waiter and definitely made you feel like family, he also recommended another place for seafood paella and wow was that place amazing too! I sent my friends the next day and they felt the same way such a great experience and the food is to die for.

Two of them had no taste what so ever. Even with eyes open I could not finger out what was in them. The explained to me that it had mushrooms...I was hungry and the dish was not sufficient, so I ordered two more tapas. The vegetable milf was acceptable.At the end of the day, only the beer was up to expectations.The personnel is welcoming and smiling, but when next to me on the bar by accident somebody dropped half of his tapas (the place is very small!), they did not even think of replacing.

50,Great food and service,"On returning to Barcelona after two weeks away this was the one place my husband and I wanted to go back to first. I recommend it very strongly, especially if you are unfamiliar with Spanish food and could use a guide, or if you have dietary restrictions that mean you need to know what is in a dish ahead of time.Both of our dinners here were excellent, great service and care taken by Oliver and Mona borh. We did the menu option where they select an assortment of tapas for us. I don't eat pork, and both times our waiters were very respectful and diligent in selecting dishes that were ok for me to eat. Mona in particular was very thoughtful in explaining exactly what dishes were what and which things I could eat. If we went back again, now that I am more familiar with the menu options I would want to pick my own (hamburguesa de la casa, Catalan bread, pollo picante...). But it would be a tough call, since the little extras in the fixed menu, the appetizer tortilla de patatas and after-dinner sweet drink, were so nice.I also appreciated that we were able to order drinks while waiting in line.

It is hard to pick a favourite dish as they were all fantastic but a few standouts are the chorizo sandwich, the cauliflower and cheese and the meat stack.

50,Amazing last evening,"So, I usually only write reviews on hotels (once being a hotelier myself) however this was too brilliant to pass up on!We visited Bodega on our last evening in Barcelona and it’s is a beautiful quirky little gem in the centre of town which always has a stream of people out front.When we arrived we had 2 couples in front of us, but were assured by our lovely waitress Mona that a table would be no more than 15 minutes. While we waited she took our drinks order and we were able to stand outside in the sun enjoying a glass of Sangria - which is an absolute must, by the way.When we got in to the restaurant (only a 15 minute wait) we were originally sat a small table and then moved over to the bar. This place is definitely designed for only 2 people and it was absolutely tiny, which gives it a real charm. Down the road they do have another restaurant for 2+ guests so you don’t have to miss out if there is more of you.Once seated we decided to go for the 30€ surprise mix. This consisted of 2 appetisers, 8 tapas and a shot of baileys at the end - for this price how could we not. The owner (forgive me I did not catch his name) was fantastic and came over to take our order in a timely fashion. When choosing this specific menu he asked if we ate everything, if there were any allergies, if we liked spice or not, to give him a feel for what we would like. Do bare in mind though they do not offer seafood or fish tapas if that is what you are after.The dishes came up at a nice pace, appetisers first, 2 tapas next and then the other 5 and we didn’t feel rushed at all even though the line of people was getting longer.The food in itself is great and comes from all different regions; Catalonia, Basque Country etc. So you get a real good feel for everything, and we had things we’d never had before.When the bill came we honestly couldn’t believe how cheap it was and what amazing quality everything is.

40,No seafood or fish,We chose to have 8 tapas chosen for us starting with a plate of local meats. There was choice of meat or non meat dishes and the choice of spicy/non spicy. The meat dish was wonderful then the other dished started coming. I felt slightly rushed at times and some of the tapas were a little heavy. The meal was finished with a cream liqueur.The restaurant is quite dark though atmospheric and the seating is very limited. There is a twin restaurant serving the same food just further down the lane where overflow customers were sent.Credit cards are not accepted and plastic straws are still being used.Show less,"Reviewed June 14, 2019",Date of visit: June 2019

My girlfriend and I came in on a weeknight, and although there was a line outside the door (the restaurant is small), our wonderful server Mona came outside to take drink orders while we waited (we recommend the Sangria!!). Mona served us the whole night and was very polite and helpful. We ordered the 8 surprise tapas option, and she made sure to accommodate for my girlfriend's lactose allergy.

50,Wow this place is amazing! You must visit here,"Where do I begin when reviewing this restaurant!Let’s start with Oliver. What a gent! He was warm and welcoming, happy to advise and give recommendations about all of the dishes. He gave us a new tapas to try and asked for our thoughts and if it could be improved.You can tell that he loves this place. We can’t wait to come back to visit.This place is so amazing we went twice in our 4 day visit.The staff are extremely friendly and by the end of the meal you feel like you have just eaten at a friends house, they are that friendly.The menu is amazing value for money. There are 2 options.Option 1 is just tapasOption 2 is iberico ham, cheese and tomato bread.You can also just select your own tapas if you like.All of the tapas is on the bar and is all freshly made and cooked to order. There is a total of 24 different tapas to try.The thing we both like about this place is that you can either select your own dishes or have the staff select them for you.If you let the staff select them, they select their favourite dishes and they you tell them which you preferred.The best dish we had was the iberico pork tenderloin. Just superb, so simple but full of flavour.Other dishes we loved were the mash potato, with veggies, topped with cheese and crispy Parma ham (this is like the English bubble and squeak)There was a slightly spicy (just a gentle warmth) egg dish. This had red and green peppers in it but was so light to eat.There are still dishes we would love to try and can’t wait to come back to this place.This restaurant only accepts cash and there maybe a queue as the place only seats about 20 people. But don’t be put off by that as the food is spectacular.Show less","Reviewed June 9, 2019",Date of visit: June 2019

We did the 20 euro per person tasting plate, which got us a delicious bruschetta type baguette with manchugo cheese, iberian ham and tomatoes, 8 tapas and an apertif at the end.

50,Lovely food service and atmosphere,"I went to this place based on TripAdvisor recommendations. Please note they have two branches of the same restaurant along the same street around 100 meters apart. One is bigger than the other and can accommodate bigger groups.The place is in the gothic quarter off La Rambla street. It is not so big, but perhaps it’s crowdedness and coziness adds to the atmosphere.I was received and accommodated quickly. Jenni attended to me explained my options, and I ended up seated at bar table having a Cabarnet Catalunya wine, and two traditional CatalunyanTapas: Trinxta and escalivada. Trinxta is potatoes, eggs, and Iberian ham, while escalivada is a vegetarian dish containing peppers and mushrooms. Soon Jennifer alerted me that a table was free where I can sit and eat more comfortably. I was offered a free Bayleys-like shooter at the end.The atmosphere is nice: crowded, nice music playing, very lively.

Oliver, Sophia and Mona went out of their way to cater to anything we wanted before we even had to ask. There are actually TWO of these restaurants about 1 minute apart from each other on the same little street. One (the one where we were) is for one to two-people only.

Although this can sometimes be overcome when the food is high quality - this ain't it.Perhaps we were jaded from San Sebastián, but this was by far the most average food we had after spending the past two weeks in Granada, Cordoba, Seville, and San Sebastián.We waited in line for about 45 minutes (place seats about 20 people, max), but I'm not even factoring this into my rating.Don't be fooled.Show less","Reviewed May 12, 2019",Date of visit: May 2019

50,Great little spot for a Tapas fix,"My regular haunt when in Barcelona and in need of somewhere central and reliable for tapas fix.I was just in Barcelona overnight ahead of an early morning flight home and went for a wander around for the evening. So many of the places around Placa Real are completely over-priced and entirely tourist-focussed, but Bodega Biarritz is a hidden gem, and very reasonable. Of course, given its location, it's not going to be some off-the-beaten-track neighbourhood local, but the food and wine are very good, the staff are friendly and helpful, and the vibe is quirky and fun.No reservations, and gets very busy, so go early if you can. If not they serve you wine as you queue, and its usually the catalyst to some interactions with other diners, as are the small tables, the tiny footprint, and the lively atmosphere once in.On this occasion, our server was Mona, who was very engaging, attentive and fun, as well as turning out to share an interesting heritage with my dining companion. It seems most of the staff are Post-Grad University students, so you get a bit of education with your tapas - on this occasion the environmental challenges faced by Leopards and Cheetahs in Iran- I didn't even know there were any... but I do now!

50,"Great Find, Great Food, Great Price","We went to Bodega Biarritz on our last night in Barcelona, wanted to enjoy tapas and to try something different. This place was very small but very intimate. We sat at the bar at the back of the restaurant and was plenty of space we needed for 2 people. The place was crowded and we felt extremely lucky to get right in (we realized when we left that there was a line / long wait). The tapas were amazing.We selected a menu option where they bring you any 8 tapas that they choose. The instructions were that we would try what they brought us and if there was anything we didn't like, they would swap it out with something else, no questions, only smiles. They first brought 2 very different style/tasting tapas. Both were delicious. Then they asked us which one we preferred. Based on that, they selected the remaining 6. Everything they brought was incredible so we never had to swap anything out. Also, it was extremely filling. At the beginning, I was sure that splitting 8 tapas between the 2 of us wouldn't be enough food but I was struggling at the end.The service was also fantastic! The servers who brought us food were so friendly and fast with any requests we had.And then finally the check... this was by far the lowest cost meal we enjoyed over our 10 day Spanish travels. The cost for the food was so reasonable and the wine was really well priced and extremely tasty. This was such a fun and intimate experience. I wish we could've stayed there longer to enjoy drinks with the staff but unfortunately, once the food is done, they ask customers to go elsewhere to continue drinks so they can serve the waiting line outside.Overall, I highly recommend.Show less","Reviewed April 17, 2019",Date of visit: April 2019

It is small like people say but when we arrived a girl called Sabrina walked us to their other restaurant which was a few mins away. She then stayed to serve us through out and was brilliant. The food was amazing I cannot recommend the fixed menu enough. We opted for the 40 euro plan and they did a half menu to make it for the 3 of us. With this and two large beers, 2 small beer, glass of sangria and 2 riojas the bill came to 85 euros (Inc service) which was brilliant. Had too much food tbh and all of it was sooo tasty and was served very quickly. Don't forget that this is a cash only restaurant so get euros first.

GIMME DA TAPAS and PAS ME DA NATY!!!,"Housed along a dainty side cobbled side street just off the Rambla, your eyes and feet have not deceived you here (DO NOT TURN AROUND AND HEAD BACK INTO THE TOURIST VENUS-FLYTRAP OF OVER CONJESTED PEOPLE TRAFFIC) and instead carry on going. Upon approaching the small, quaint, curtain closed and candle lit entrance you may be welcomed by a slight queue of hungry avid revellers. Do not fear. The wait will not be long and I’m sure you’ll be quickly greeted by a member of the lovely serving staff.. if it is your lucky day, like ours, then you will be greeted by Naty..! A genuinely lovely smile and welcome that would lead you well into any astablishment with open arms. Once again as it was our lucky day .. and said astablishment was the AMAZING Bodega Biarritz!! The venue was highly recommended from a local source living in Barcelona.. and MY BOY(/GIRL) it did not disappoint.. ONE (tapas-y) BIT!With SO much to offer (Don’t take the chalk board menus as gospel as there is a heck of a lot more inside) it can easily be overwhelming for a personal sufferer of DFOI (Drastic-Food-Ordering-Indecisiveness) Do not fear... Once again.. Naty comes to the rescue!! As our party was mixed with vegetarians and meat eaters she kindly offered the best thing to do would be to stick to the set menu. I am usually hesitant to go for this as I like to pick and choose at my own will. And with a vegie present it can sometimes cause conflictions at ordering. HOWEVER.. what a great decision it turned out to be!!! (Thankyou Naty!) We were welcomed with delicious appetisers alongside a thorough explanation and deep ingredient break down of what wonders awaited our taste buds. Needless to say it went down like the first cold IPA on a warm summers day... just leaving us yurning for more!! Once finished, the dishes kept on coming, alongside the smiles, service and explanations.. Each dish somehow topping the last, and despite what appears to be small portions... they are very very filling! This is where the tasting menu was perfect as you are given a real local experts selection of the best the place has to offer.My only complaint from the evening is that I simply ran out of room in my stomach to further consume what other culinary delights awaited to wonder my insides. Anyway... I could go on for ever and now need to stop so you can get your shoes on and immediately head to the bar yourself!Highly recommend the food, drink (Sangria was wonderful) , service and atmosphere.Take your date, take your friends , take your family, your colleagues , take your nan.AAAA+*Thankyou ,MShow less","Reviewed March 21, 2019",Date of visit: March 2019

50,INCREDIBLE!,"We went to this place after reading reviews online that sounded absolutely amazing. We were definitely not disappointed. There was a small queue to wait for a table so we were brought drink menus and the drinks were served to us whilst standing outside in the queue (marvellous Sangria). When we went inside it was a very small, quirky and characteristic place, the sort of place from a film, and not an overly large bright tourist trap like some places.Our waitress, Naty, informed us she had only been working there for two weeks, but she was without a doubt a star at her job. We explained to her we both had severe allergies to peanuts and so to make sure none of the tapas brought to us had any nuts on, and she took this seriously and carefully explained each hand selected tapas dish to us in detail once it was served. She was thorough and very chatty, lovely girl!The food was TO DIE FOR. We have been talking about it for the past three days since we visited this place; each tapas that was served to us was absolutely delicious and perfect portion sizes too, we didn’t feel too bloated or full up even after generous helpings.If you want a tapas restaurant off the beaten track that isn’t over priced and overly crowded with tourists then we would highly recommend this; you won’t regret it! Thanks for the amazing service from Naty (please give her our compliments and thanks once again) and thanks for the food we will forever remember from our trip to Barcelona.

It also came with tiny shot glass aperitifs at the end - boy were they alcoholic and strong!We were very pleased with the food. It was a good value and everything was tasty. If you’re vegetarian or have any other food restrictions or preferences, you can tell your server and they’ll choose accordingly.

He explained the menu to us, and we went for the first option, where you get a mystery selection of tapas - though they ask you first for any allergies and whether there is anything you don’t like. We thoroughly enjoyed most of the tapas, and the couple I wasn’t so keen on was because I’m picky rather than anything wrong with them!

However you get the tapas chosen for you in a sort of lucky dip format. Some might think this is a strange way to eat... and it is... but definatly made for a unique experience.Getting back to the food, a lot of the things that came out I would of never chosen for myself, however everything that came was delicious and we sent back clean plates each time. You also can have the option to purchase additional tapas at the end (Which you can choose).Likewise the servers were very friendly and helpful, and again made the experience great.This place is popular, and very small which did create a bit of a queue outside.

40,Great tapas,"One thing that you should know when visiting Bodega Biarritz 1881, is that if you find the restaurant that's just off the side street from Placa Reial and it happens to be full, if you carry on further along the same street you will find another Bodega Biarritz that should be able to accommodate you. That's what we found and the tapas is pretty impressive. We opted on the menu for eight tapas for 39 euro which are picked at random and we enjoyed everything that was served to us. At first we were served a selection of meats and cheeses which we initially thought was part of the tapas but we couldn't have been more wrong as two more courses of four tapas arrived after this. If you're a seafood fan, then you might want to try elsewhere as it's stated at the entrance that seafood isn't on the menu.Bodega Biarritz is a wine bar primarily and it was great to soak up the atmosphere.

50,Gorgeous tapas served in a cool way!,"We tried to get in here on Friday night (last week) but it was so packed! So we went back on Saturday and we were so glad we did. This place is tiny but the space is used well. All tapas is laid out on the bar- you can go for a surprise option where the chef chooses a certain amount of dishes for you or you can choose items from the bar. They're then heated up and served. We had a seat at a small table but then moved to the bar when it became available. It was so much fun- we picked lots of dishes and every single one was gorgeous!! I also had a few different types of wine, again all were lovely. The staff were very friendly and attentive. Prices were very affordable.I'm already wishing we could go back here and if we return to Barcelona, we definitely will!Show less","Reviewed November 10, 2018",Date of visit: November 2018

20,Disappointed,"We had high expectations of this restaurant because of its good rating and reviews. We were truly disappointed by the food. We felt like all tapas tasted the same, heavy and covert by cheese. We didn't receive anything fresh and light to balance the flavours in the 8 surprised tapas menu... It felt more like bar food than a restaurant to us.Show less","Reviewed November 5, 2018",Date of visit: October 2018
20,Fried. No flavour.,"We had high hopes for this place after reading all the reviews. We waited outside and even pull out cash from the bank machine because that’s all they accepted. Honestly very disappointed. We ordered the most expensive “fixed set”. The starter was...meh. 5 or 6 strips of Ibhirian ham, some super thin strips of cheese, 2 cut up cherry tomatoes. When the first set came, it looked great! But the food had ZERO flavour. Every dish tasted the same. Cheese. Fried. A vegetable here and there.

You can also swap any you don't fancy for free. When we went up to the bar, the chef explained what each dish was which was really helpful. Our host Kareen was so welcoming and helpful which made our visit even better. We would not hesitate to come back here when we visit Barcelona again.

We opted for the ""surprise"" tapas which meant that Sherry did a cursory interview of our preferences and then tailored our dining experience. As each collection of tapas was brought out, she took the time to explain, in great detail, what we were about to enjoy.

We went for the option where your server chooses a selection of 8 tapas for you, and I can honestly say that every dish was delicious and with its own set of flavours.

50,Don't Miss Experience.,"After decades of travel I've come to accept that there seems to exist a general rule which dictates that, when on holiday, one can discover a restaurant with great food at reasonable prices, or one with a wonderful location and an ideal atmosphere, but seldom can you ""have it all"". Well, I can happily tell you that Bodega Biarritz 1881 is the exception to that rule----it does, in fact, ""have it all"". Located in Barcelona's Barri Gotic or old quarter, the walk to the restaurant helps set the mood. Inside the Bodega, one finds a rectangular room where you can be seated at the bar on the left (upon which are displayed the various tapas on offer) or at the small tables on the right (which are half barrels set into the wall), with the setting enhanced by subdued lighting and a lively noise level that still allows for reasonable conversation. The menu is compact in that it allows you to select individual tapas or one of two Chef's Choice options. Even if you go with the Chef's Choice, you still retain some control in that the server will first inquire if you have any allergies or particular dislikes. We chose the more expansive Chef's Choice option and found each tapas presented to be outstanding. Not only were our servers efficient, but they were friendly and fun, explaining each dish and ensuring we were always well taken care of. While Bodega Biarritz 1881 does not offer any seafood or fish dishes, we were very satisfied with every dish we had though I usually restrict my diet to seafood and fish. From the gracious welcome to the complimentary caramel shots that concluded our meal and the wonderful food, service and atmosphere in-between, Bodega Biarritz 1881 is a great experience.Show less","Reviewed October 14, 2018",Date of visit: September 2018

40,Great tapas!,"I came here based on a recommendation by friends who had recently spend several weeks in Spain. I dined at the original Bodega Biarritz (i believe there is another a few 100m away). The space itself is tiny, and depending on what time you get there you may have to wait in line. Service is fantastic,even when in line we were able to order drinks. You can pick from a wide range of tapas on offer which is then warmed and served. Lots of variety - even for vegetarians. I could easily spend a few hours with friends eating and drinking here, however you do feel a little conscious of people waiting for tables. It seemed to be more of a touristy/expat place rather than somewhere locals would go. Overall, I enjoyed it. Would probably go back.Show less","Reviewed October 11, 2018",Date of visit: June 2018

At the end we ordered some of the meatballs as never got this served on our set menu, they tasted like soft tinned meatballs from Tesco...I feel the only reason this place is so popular is because of the location as is just off the square but there really are much more authentic places for tapas!

40,Amazing Experience!,"My girlfriend and I visited this restaurant last week when wandering around in Barcelona, Spain. We actually walked by one day, to see a long line up in front, when we then read a sign saying there was another location close by. We walked over to the second location only to see another line up so we thought, this place must be great! We decided we’d go back the next day, and hopefully miss the rush, so that’s exactly what we did.We weren’t quite sure what the restaurant was all about, we just knew it was busy. We actually got lucky and got a seat right away. We happened to miss the rush that started shortly after we sat down. We were pleasantly surprised to see that on the menu, there basically was no menu. The concept was cool - you sit, option to have a starter or not, and you are served a surprise variety of 8 different tapas. There is no fish, only meat and veggies. They ask if you have a preference on which you’d like more and whether or not you like spicey foods. We asked for an even mix of each option, including some spice!!Each tapa they brought out was better than the next. It was quite small inside, but cute and intimate. Even the sangria they served was amazing! One of the best parts of our experience was meeting our server Kareen. The entire staff was lovely; Kareen in particular had such a spontaneous and fun spunk to her which truly made for a great experience. She had a smile the entire time. Once asked where we were from (Toronto) she went ahead and played the new song “In My Feelings” which got the whole restaurant to respond with smiles and laughter. She truly made our experience special! OH, and how could I forget the liquor shots they gave us at the end of the meal, which was on the house. It was literally like drinking a dessert. So good! I’d recommend this place to anyone visiting Barcelona who’s looking for great food and great service. My gf and I truly enjoyed our evening and would go back in a heart beat.Show less","Reviewed August 20, 2018",Date of visit: August 2018

50,Great Food and Service,"Went to their first location at 10 PM and there was an hour wait. A server came out to take drink orders while we waited in line. She did tell us their other restaurant was a little bigger and was about a 2 minute straight line walk to get there. We decided to try that option. It was still a 40 minute wait at the other location. That location also had a server taking drink orders in line so at least we had something to quench our thirst while waiting.We decided on the 8 piece, chefs choice for 2 people tapas option for $29E. There is a 10 piece option for $39E which included Iberico ham and Manchego cheese, but we had already tried enough of both at La Boqueria Market that day. I am always hesitant to do the ""chefs choice"" option since usually they are trying to get rid of the items no one is buying. The first two items were OK so I thought maybe it was a bad choice. The next six items were so good it completely changed my mind about our decision. If you do not like any item when they bring it, let them know and they will change it for something else, no questions asked. If you want to view everything available you can walk up to the bar and make your own choices, or look at the menu board on the wall for what is available that day. If you are a seasoned tapas person the menu board could work for you I am not an expert, so would recommend them making the choices for you. They will ask you what types of food you like, spicy, or mild, etc. to get an idea of your preferences.The server, Sherry was available all the time so we never had to wait for anything. She was good at explaining (in English) what we were being served. The service was expedient, but we never felt rushed. They had menus in English and French.Had a house Mojito while waiting in line and a glass of Rose with the meal. Good match with the food.Went with my 13 year old daughter who is a picky eater and she was very happy with her first experience eating tapas.They are a cash only restaurant. With that said the prices are very reasonable for both food and drink.Show less","Reviewed August 17, 2018",Date of visit: August 2018
50,Great drinks and tapas- Long Waits during the summer.,"We first went to the Bodega Biarritz closer to the square. Wait of over an hour- they advised us to go to the other location where they said we would have a shorter wait and more comfortable seats- so off we went. Location #2 the wait was just as long, and the seats that finally came open were also bar stools. However, we got some sangria while we waited and stayed on the line. Staff did a good job communicating wait times etc. and stayed positive and engaged. Once seated, went for the chef's choice for tapas. Each dish was thoughtfully prepared, fresh and delicious. Next time I will pick my own as there were one or two I would have liked to try that I didn't get to taste. Despite the wait we all enjoyed our meal. The tapas was really good and for 5 people with drinks we spent about 25-30 euros per person, and were so full we wondered if we would be able to stroll home.Show less","Reviewed August 13, 2018",Date of visit: August 2018

Being just 2 of us, we had no issues squeezing into a smaller table. We went with the tasting menu and let them surprise us with their recommendations. We personally liked this as we wanted to be adventurous and be surprised. If you are a picky eater this may not work for you. All the items are displayed and then heated up so it is easy to pick what you want as well. We found everything very delicious. It actually was one of our favorite restaurants as we enjoyed the atmosphere and novelty of the experience. The sangria and wine were good too. But if you want to sit there and enjoy wine for awhile this is not possible as you need to be eating to continue to keep your seat.

However, they serve food on small plates and though there were 5 of us having the meat menu, they didn’t scale up the food portions. This meant we had half a meat ball each and one mouthful of everything which I think was ridiculous. We tried to ask for more food but they weren’t having it. So I’d recommend this place for no more than 2-3 sized parties.Show less","Reviewed July 19, 2018",Date of visit: July 2018
30,Good for a quick visit but don't expect too much,"The ranking in here is really misleading. The tapas are all pre-cooked and they are displayed all on a counter from which you choose the ones you want (don't take the surprise menu, it's just a hoax to get you paying more). I was a bit sceptical about even eating things that have been out on a table for I don't know how long. The menu promises that the waiters will go through with all the choices with you, but no one there explained what the tapas included, so we just picked some of them by random.After choosing the ones you wanted, they heat them all up (which is also weird, I would have loved to have some cold ones too). All of the tapas seemed pretty similar and all of them were really heavy, as we had 3 pieces each and were pretty full afterwards. Also ou might expect from the name that they have a nice selection of wines, but they only have few choices for white and red wine which was disappointing. They do not accept any cards, so remember to take cash with you.Show less","Reviewed July 15, 2018",Date of visit: July 2018

If you visited a restaurant that is ranked 28th out of 8,676 (as I write) in a fantastic city like Barcelona, would you expect to be given pre-cooked food? I visited here on 9th July, there were around 20 tapas dishes all precooked set out on the bar in the sweltering heat, none of them were covered. You then choose which dishes you want and they are heated up in front of you! You then get ""stuff"" added.

20,"Ok food, just go early and avoid their ""surprise menu""","The restaurant prepares many of its tapas in advance for display (similar to cafeteria style), and heats / garnishes when ordered. Itself, this is not a problem given the quick turnover.Unfortunately, towards the end of the night, they stop replenishing dishes so selection becomes very limited. Their menu focuses around a ""surprise menu"" (8 tapas for 27-39 euro), where you get 8 tapas of their choosing. However, towards closing time (we went an hour before closing), the surprise menu became a clearance of whatever was leftover, regardless of what dietary preferences you state when they ask.Overall, food was decent, though debatable if worth waiting >30 minutes for in line.

The owner Manuel pulled out all the stops and managed to seat us in 10 minutes.The intimate atmosphere made for a very cosy and socialable experience. It was nice to not eat in a stuffy,formal environment given that we had our 3 year old daughter with us.The tapas style food we had was exceptional quality and really good value at around €40 for sharing courses that filled us up!Manuel was funny, welcoming and made a real fuss over Sophie. We left feeling like we'd just been hosted by family!

Up and down through little winding streets till we discovered Bodega.A huge draw to us was no seafood tapas. I know that sounds weird but, all of us live in Coastal areas so we are very picky about our seafood. (We went to my families house in Barcelona for Seafood Paella!)First you can go up to the bar and pick the tapas you would like to try. But, this is the better option...Order the mixed tapas for two. We were traveling with another couple so we both did it this way. They pic the mix and bring them to you. We plopped them in the center of the table and each took a bite of every item. If you do not like something they will swap it for another item.Plus, the wait staff and owner are super nice!Go, Eat , Enjoy!Show less","Reviewed May 14, 2018",Date of visit: March 2018

10,Airline food,"For my last night in Barcelona, I wanted a fitting farewell indulging in a wide array of tapas. Rather than be immersed in Barcelona's culinary heritage, I was transported back to my latest transatlantic flight. Of the 4 tapas ""specially curated"" for me, 3 reminded me of airline food: bland, tough meats nuked in the microwave, devoid of any description. Seriously, when the waitress brought over my food, she just mentioned what the meats were (""chicken,"" ""turkey,"" and ""hamburger""), not how they were prepared or seasoned.I should have paid attention to the restaurant's location in a more touristy part of town or even its sign by the door, indicating that by a certain point the line would be an hour long, almost like Disneyland.I must mention that despite the abysmal food, my waiter was very understanding. The restaurant has a policy where if you don't like any or several of your food items, they will replace them for you. Just mere bites in, I told my waiter I was expecting Spanish tapas and was disappointed in the taste, and that rather than get new tapas I wanted to just try another restaurant. He was very understanding and respectful, and allowed me to return my uneaten meal for no charge.Save the airline food for when you're a captive audience on economy class, skip the wait and go try out real tapas somewhere else.Show less","Reviewed March 26, 2018",Date of visit: March 2018

We walked in around 6pm which is not dinner time by any means...we were immediately asked if we were going to eat, we couldn't just drink. We agreed to eat as the array of tapas laid out over the bar looked pretty good. Nothing is labeled nothing has a price, they hand you a menu that says tapas range between 1 and 6 euros. You have 2 tasting menus to choose from but neither say what is included for the 30 or 40 euros. Although everything looked good it tasted like it was out since lunch, a bunch of reheated croquettes, and small bites that lacked any taste. The sangria tasted like the generic bottled kind you can buy at a carrefour. To top it off we ordered a plate of Jamón Ibérico which was dry and tasted as if it had come out of a opened cryovac sleeve for 9 euros. When we brought it up to the ""manager"" a lady who could care less as long as we just left she actually had the nerve to say they dry it out on purpose.Don't bother coming here they have let their name go to their heads and don't care about their product any longer.Show less","Reviewed March 21, 2018",Date of visit: March 2018

50,Fantastic Food Visit a Must !!!,"Went to Bodega Biarritz last year when in Barcelona but it was on one of the days it was closed so made a point of visiting this year on a different day as heard so many good reviews. Not disappointed, food was absolutely amazing, staff so friendly. We had a wait for a table but were served drinks whilst queuing outside, nice cold beer and wine. As we had turned up at a very busy time 8pm we were advised that the 4 of us might not be able to sit together , we accepted this, however we were seated together and at the bar which is were we really wanted to sit so that was a bonus. We decided on option 2 which is a starter and then the staff choose 8 tapas items for you. If we didn't like any of them we could change. Everything tasted amazing and we had such a good time.

If like me you didn’t have much clue one of the waiters will go up and down the bar telling you what each dish is. Special shout out to Nathan who helped us pick and was very friendly.

50,Happy we came to this restaurant and returned a second time,"This tapas bar was convenient to where we were staying near the Placa Reial. We came originally on Tuesday and very disappointed to find It closed, but returned on Wednesday and because we thought It so good came back on the Thursday evening. It is tiny and they seat as many people as they can. It's well worth waiting for a space and drinks are offered if you have to wait in the line outside. We chose the special menu of 8 tapas each, which the staff chose for us. If you don't like something, they will readily change. This was ideal for us as we are not tapas 'experts'. The food was good, a very reasonable price. A major consideration for this little bar is the staff. They all seem to really enjoy their job, take the trouble to talk to you and ensure you are happy with the food and service.

We had to que for around 15 minutes although were prepared to wait longer as we’d heard it was worth the wait...and boy it was well worth it. We were given drinks whilst we waited and even got a member of staff to take photos of us as it was my wife’s 40th and wanted a memorable tapas dinner. Staff were all amazing and we were greeted by warm smiles and friendly faces. We were huddled together on a small table and after our 1st course were quickly moved to the bar where there was more room. We met Nicholas who was equally friendly and couldn’t have been more helpful, even taking photos and a selfie to boot! We opted for option 2 on the menu and each dish was authentic and lovingly prepared by their excellent chefs in their compact open kitchen. We had cured ham to start and then came a plate with an amazing Catalan pie which tasted exquisite and accompanied mouth watering vegetable bites. The spicy chicken was to die for and their Catalonian spinach omelette was equally authentic and tasted amazing. We will definitely visit next time we come to Barcelona and highly recommend this traditional and authentic Tapas restaurant...thanks to all the team we had a lovely meal and my wife loved this birthday treat!

40,Atypical tapas. Tiny space,"Went here because we were near Placa Reial and decided to go based on review. We got there around 7:30pm and there were already 3 couples infront of us and were told there was a 50 minutes wait. We were fine because we wanted to try it based on reviews.There was a curtain covering the entrance so you couldn’t see inside. The tapas bar right accross it was as busy we were tempted to try it but we decided to stay. There were friends of 3 behind us which were told “it’s hard to get a table for three because there are many couples inside and we need two couples sitting next to each other to leave before we can seat you” so they ended up leaving.When we got inwe couldn’t pick the tapas until they call us. My husband got up and chose 4 tapas. They prepared it, added some diced veggies and tomato pure under it and it was delicious. (Not the typical spanish style tapas) A lot of the dishes had cheese and egg type omelettes and veggie stacks. to be honest It tastes and looked like American/Australian food in tapas stule. Nevertheless it was very flavoursome we wanted to order more BUT I couldn’t until they called us to pick the tapas fromthe tapas bar.As we were eating there were empty seats and people were not being let in (or at least they were so slowww calling people in) maybe to keep people curious outside.

50,OMG. Flavors Bursting! Staff is Enchanting!,"Absolutely loved this place. I’ve been all over Barcelona eating everywhere. All the food here was delicious. They were full when we arrived and we decided to wait because we were greeted by a very friendly and hospitable staff member, Nicole. She offered to send us to their other location a block away and went there to look and came back because Nicole was so nice to us and felt she would make the experience worth the wait. We were right. On our return back to 1881, we were greeted by the manager who was nice and welcoming, like Nicole. She offered us wine on the street and we waited a few minutes with other patrons who were waiting their turn. Everyone started talking about where they were from: UK, Italy, France, Washington, and New Jersey. Very nice discussion.We got seated 15 minutes later and got waited on by Nicole, the manager, and some great staff. We opted for the staff selection menu and they picked out vegetarian only and some poultry foods (we don’t eat pork or beef). If you don’t like what they pick, just tell them and they bring you out something else without any attitude whatsoever. They just want you to enjoy the meal.Everything was spectacular! Bursting with flavor. We had red wine and then switched to a nice dry Spanish white.I cannot recommend this place enough! Worth the wait.Here are a few things you should be aware of:— They don’t serve seafood— Prob not appropriate for vegan (but vegetarians will be happy as can be — I’ll admit they were my fav dishes even though I’m a meat eater)— not appropriate for large groups from what we saw, very cozy and tight space, I would say your party should be 2-4 max.— cash only and no credit cards— red and white wines were great but avoid the sangria which was the only item we didn’t like.

We picked the meal for 2 where they pick the meals for you, all you need to say is a food you do not like i.e goats cheese, mushrooms and anything they must know e.i allergies, vegitarian, vegan and they will make sure theu cater to your needs. If you do not like a dish they will happily swap it for you to something else and they explain what the dish contains.

We waited outside the cordon they had placed across the entrance whilst waiting for a table. We were offered drinks and within 5 minutes 2 tables/barrels with stools next to them were available. Now you will either like this or you won’t but we loved it as it added to the whole atmosphere. We sat on one barrel and the kids behind. We went for the set menu and ordered drinks. The food came thick and fast but was of a very high standard. Service was excellent and when we stated a preference for certain foods the set menu was quickly changed to our preferred food.

Even though you could sit here for a very very long time, because of its charm and character and atmosphere, it's an in and out establishment. You'll be seated along the bar or in corner tables for 2-3 people at most, slugging wine and picking at plates or tapas you've selected, or you've let your waiter select for you.

It was our first tapas bar experience so we asked if we could be seated by the bar so we could be closer to the amazing looking dishes. She politely explained that there was a group of three in the queue and those three empty seats by the bar were reserved for odd numbered groups, which we absolutely understood, but she was very apologetic about it and offered to move us to a bigger table as it became available.Because of the special concept where the restaurant will pick 8 dishes for us (and we could reject any of them if we didn't like them), Nicole religiously checked in with us on the types of allergies and preferences we had before we started.

30,You'll not come across any locals eating here!,"Sometimes Trip Advisor gets it wrong. Bodega Biarritz is case and point. Scores highly on trip advisor but is really kind of tacky.We ended up here because we failed to make a reservation in a different eatery and it was super late. I went onto trip advisor in a state of panic and not having any time to research properly. We arrived at the eatery and waited about 20 minutes.The staff ( who couldn't have been nicer or more accommodating ) were wonderful. I ordered a glass of the house rioja. It was cheap and tasted cheap. Think vinegar!We ordered the forty euro menu and with the exception of the bread and ham, everything else was just fairly bland. They reheat everything which is kind of off putting. Somethings need to be reheated when ordering this kind of food, but usually things with pastry. Also, every item we received seemed to be smothered in melted cheese. This is right in the heart of the most touristy area of the city. If you're going to slum it around Ramblas then you could do worse I'm sure, but one ought to avoid this area completely if you're looking for good food.Show less","Reviewed October 23, 2017",Date of visit: October 2017

50,"Excellent Tapas, small place, but efficiently run!","I ate at Bodega Biarritz 1881 with my wife in July 2017. The place is small and tight, but they were packed with perhaps 25 customers in the tiny place. At least one of the visitors told me that he had eaten here the day before and was back today because it was so good. We waited about 20 minutes for a table at 9:00 pm and they served us drinks while we waited. When we were seated, you have the option of picking a set number of dishes for a fixed price or you can have it open ended (which is what we went with). All the food is stacked tall on these large plates like you see in the pictures, and the bar table is lined with perhaps 20 different dishes with quite the variety. You point to the ones you want, they heat it up and bring it to your table. I'm not sure how they heated it up (it didn't seem to be microwave), but it was fresh, and uniformly hot. We had about 10 different dishes, and *each and every one* was delicious in its own way. Comparing this with tapas restaurants in the US that I have been to, it seemed to be way better for some reason. It could be that I was just hungrier, having had to eat 3 hours later than usual, but nevertheless, this is a place worth visiting!Show less","Reviewed September 13, 2017",Date of visit: July 2017

10,SCAM,"This was my first ever taste of Tapas so I was very excited to try. The menu appealed as it offered a set surprise meal consisting of 8 tapas ""dishes"" and a starter for €39 per couple, which was very good value in comparison to others.We sat in a very crowded room pushed up against the entrance with other customers and staff squeezing passed us, however we continued.The first plate arrived and the waiter explained the contents and we tucked in. This plate was very nice. The second plate shortly followed, and similar to the first, was nice and we finished.Thus far, the tapas experience was very good. Eagerly anticipating my next dish, I was uninformed but slowly realised that what I had received was all I was going to get.Now by plate, do not misunderstand me, what I received for two customers was actually one kebab skewer, one mini jacket potato, one fried goats cheese and a mini pizza. Not authentic, not filling, not worth it.After consulting with the waiter and manager, this plate was what they called ""child tapas"" and was 4 of the 8 Tapas we ordered, likewise for our second plate. By dish they meant item and by item they meant one small item for 2 customers.Very disappointing experience.P.S my girlfriend, a regular Tapas enjoyer, agreed with my utter disappointment.Show less","Reviewed September 10, 2017",Date of visit: September 2017

So we made that our choice for the next night.We waited less than an hour. They come up and down the line and take drink orders as you wait, which makes the wait more palatable (no pun intended).They have three options for dining - two different Chef's menus for which you let the chef choose tapas for you or your choice, where you look at the plates displayed and make your picks.

50,Amazing Experience and Tapas!,"What can I say about this place, one of the best meals I've ever had!My wife and I visited here on our last night in Barcelona after seeing it mentioned online earlier in the day. After walking down an alleyway leading from Plaça Reial we came across a small queue that we soon realised was for the restaurant. At the end of the queue was a sign saying there would be around an hour wait from this point. We were quickly greeted by a member of staff however who said the wait may not be that long and we could have a drink whilst we waited. Seeing how busy everywhere else was and being keen to try the restaurant we decided to wait.While in the queue I tried to have a little look inside to see what we could be expecting. I was surprised to see that the restaurant only had around 18-20 seats, most of which were at the bar with tables for two along the wall. Easy to see why there was a queue. But if you're looking for amazing tapas and an authentic evening in Barcelona it's well worth the wait.When we went in to the restaurant (the queue time was actually about 30 minutes) we were sat pretty much smack in the middle of the bar, which was covered with more tapas dishes that I could care to count but all of which I wanted to eat. The restaurant allows you to order individual plates but the vast majority seemed to go with the two menu options. Option One was eight tapas dishes for €27 and Option Two was €39 and consisted of Pan con Tomate followed by cheese and some incredible Iberico ham and then your eight tapas dishes. After choosing Option Two a member of staff spoke with us to find out what foods, flavours, etc. we liked and then put together the eight dishes they thought we would like by warming through the food on the bar. If you don't like something they're more than happy to change it for you, we also added a chorizo plate to our dinner.The quality and taste of the food was absolutely first class and rivals anything I've eaten in London, New York, San Francisco, etc. I have no doubt when we return to Barcelona we will be spending our first night Bodega Biarritz 1881. As a final point, the whole staff were outstanding. They literally did not stop all the time we were there but all seemed to be loving what they were doing while making sure every customer was well looked after.

At first I was unsure - the restaurant was tiny - yet, once we were seated I realised this only added to its charm! With just a few tables for two along the side and then seating a long the bar it was a bit of a squeeze - but this most definitely added to the atmosphere of the place, along with the low lighting & dark wood interior.The waitress introduced us to the menu, with options to either get a 'surprise' platter, or to pick ourselves from the array of tapas lining the bar. We decided to pick our own - and Nicholas our waiter was happy to talk us through each dish so we could select what we wanted to try (they vary from around €2-5 each)! We ended up with around 8 different tapas, which we were warmed & served to us at the bar, we opted for Sangria too! Everything was delicious and surprisingly filling! The staff were warm & welcoming, especially Nicholas & Kareen who were keen to chat :) (Salamat!)Overall a lovely experience, good food, atmosphere, pleasant staff and very reasonably priced (our bill was around €32 for two with sangria!) - Would definitely recommend to others & hope to visit again if we're ever back in Barcelona! ❤️Show less","Reviewed August 22, 2017",Date of visit: August 2017
10,"""Good tapas but a good concept for tourist trap","We ate in this restaurant few days ago. First of all, you have to wait at least more than 30 minutes because the restaurant room is extremely small. A French waitress comes to you to ask you what do you want to drink (sly because you have to stay after you took your drink). Don't taste the mojito here, unfortunately it's the worst mojito I ever drunk in Spain ! If you want to try good places for cocktails, prefer go to the Ocaña, The Paradiso or ""El Jardí"". Then, when you took place in the restaurant, we give you a very approximative menu with only two different choices and in each we choose your food for you, I'm sorry but when you have specials needs, it can be complicated ! So, if you don't want to choose one of the menus, you can also serve you tapa after tapa and here again you have a surprise : you know that prices are somewhere between EUR 1,50 and EUR 4 per tapa but you have to ask prices, it doesn't appear on the menu ! Not easy to manage your budget ! Finally, it was good but not the best tapas of BCN, the service is good but the waitress is condescending especially when you give her your opinion on the restaurant, prices are not appear clearly. If you want to drink only, do not go here because you have to eat in order to drink something. Too much conditions for this tourist trap !

The only one flaw for me (as I don't eat much meat everyday)was, that there was no crispy leaves or raw veg salat to breake the meat taste. Dishes are served in specific order, so at the beginning I felt it was too much meat at once.Despite this, everything is very smart prepared, very balanced.

We were able to move to the food counter soon after, the best place to choose food. The staff were great to explain what everything was.We went first for the 8 tapas for 27 Euro, and topped up with a couple more tapas to finish. The first batch is enough for appetite, but we didn't want to leave without sampling a couple more - they looked so enticing.The place has a rule that you can't drink at the bar with no food. It's fair enough - this buzzing spot is so popular they have to keep the customers rolling in and out.

50,Do not miss,"This is the best place I have every been for tapas, you can either let the waiter choose for you or chose which dishes you would like, none disappoint. You can sit and eat until you are bursting and wash it all down with a nice glass of sangria. The only downside is the size, it only fits around 20 people so unless you arrive early evening you will probably have to que. Great for couples however it's difficult to accommodate for larger groups so you could be in for a long wait.

20,Is this what good tapas is supposed to be?,"Was in Barcelona mid June 2017 for a trip. This was the #2 rated tapas joint on trip advisor at the time so my wife and I went to check it out. I've never had tapas before but if this is what traditional tapas is, it's really just a modified version of typical American bar snacks/appies except on skewers and/or small-ish portions. Everything seemed kind of greasy, cheese-y and heavy. They had cheeseburger (without the bun), chicken wings on a skewer, chicken breast on a skewer with various sauces drizzled on top, potatoes with cheese, sausages on a skewer, etc. You can see how it looks in all the photos. There was also no seafood option. Maybe my food expectations are skewed because I live in Vancouver where there are 1000's of healthy tasty well-executed food options.Also ate at the #1 rated tapas place at the time of my visit which is just across the street.Show less","Reviewed August 2, 2017",Date of visit: June 2017

We only ended up waiting 10 before a table was free, and you could get drinks whilst waiting!The food was exceptional, we went for option 1 - they choose 8 pieces, and if there are any you don't like you can swap it for something else. We were not disappointed, the tapas they selected were delicious and varied. Sooo tasty! Me and my friend were hesitant that 8 pieces wouldn't be enough, but by the end of it we were full.

30,Decent food but subpar service,"Came in for a quick bite and was seated at the bar area. Stools were very uncomfortable and very cramped space. On the menu it offers the staff to explain each of the tapas that are available. But when the waiter explained them, the descriptions and run down of the tapas was extremely brief and barely described the tapas. For example he would just point to a dish and say ""mushroom and garlic"" or ""tomato"" to explain the flavour of the dish but did not actually explain what the dish was. So we still don't know what we actually ate, although it tasted good and seemed to involve some kind of goat cheese mixed with tomato on a crust of some kind??Picking the tapas was also very rushed and we felt like we had no time to think about what we wanted and without actually knowing what the dishes were we Just pointed to 3 dishes that looked good. This process of selecting our food ruined the experience for me and while the food was quite good I did not enjoy the experience as a result. We also had sangria and a mojito which were not that great.Overall good food, poor seating and rushed service.Show less","Reviewed June 30, 2017",Date of visit: June 2017

You certainly do not need a menu at Bodega Biarritz as the long bar (spanning the length of the bistro) is covered with mouthwatering, mounded platters of gorgeous Tapas. You simply point and eat. On our visit, we elected to allow our sever to make sections for us which included sausages, zucchini eggplant cheese stacks, chorizo stuffed potatoes, roasted chicken skewers, Iberico Ham pastry melts, Lamb Meatballs, etc,). Each and every dish was a wonderful taste adventure. Simply delicious. We washed it all down with house made sangria (which, actually, was some of the best sangria we tasted while in Spain). We really wanted to return and try other sections on a different day but there was a huge 1 1/2 hour wait (the place is charming but very tiny).

The restaurant itself or bar is small yet cosy with all delicious choices displayed on the bar. You simply select as many as you want (the waiter explains what's what) and then it's brought to your seat - try and get one by the bar if you can as it just adds to the experience.

30,Tasty and filling but missed not having any seafood,"This place has received some great reviews and it was not a surprise that it was so busy. However, the restaurant is small, about 20 seats, so you will have to queue. A sister restaurant has opened about 100m further down the road so it's worth checking waiting times at both.The staff are friendly and welcoming which is nice to see in such a busy place. Each tapas is priced between €1.50 and €4.00 and drinks are reasonably priced too.The place has about 35 different options all of which are prepared and displayed on the counter. You can choose a surprise menu 1 or 2 where they will pick for you or simply pick the dishes you want after the chef has explained each one. A word of warning here, the tapas you choose will be picked from the dishes on display and re-heated with some additional sauces and garnishes added.In terms of taste, I can't really complain as each dish was packed with flavour. However, I felt a little disappointed that a lot of the dishes were similar in construction and generally consisted of variations of Spanish tortilla, stacked vegi's with cheese, meat skewers and potato croquettes. You will not find any seafood here as it's not their specialty.Overall, it's probably better than the tourist traps on la Rambla and the surrounding squares (although all the people in the restaurant were tourists) but I would try somewhere else next time.Show less","Reviewed June 6, 2017",Date of visit: June 2017

I'd definitely recommend going here if you're on a couples city break, I don't think it'd be ideal for a larger group of people as it is really very small.

The place is tiny -- so be prepared for a bit of a wait, though the staff is very efficient. We arrived at about 21.30, second in line, waited for about ten minutes, not really an issue. The choice of tapas is quite large -- something like 30+ items to choose from, displayed before your eyes; we were a bit overwhelmed by the selection, so we chose the complete menu for two -- 8 items to share, selected for us. The staff were exceptionally good at remembering our request for no pork -- not so trivial with tapas -- and served us a wide selection of tapas anyway. Our favorites: the pastry with goat cheese; and mushroom pie/quiche, though to be honest we enjoyed all the items.At first we sat at a side table (a bit cramped), eventually moved to the main bar, worth waiting for -- more space, plus better chance to chat with the staff, which was interesting. Turns out the same group who serve, also prepare all the tapas fresh in the late afternoon -- so it's nice to have the people who invest effort in preparation also making the recommendations and serving. Feels very homey.All in all a lovely experience -- varied and tasty, friendly, nice atmosphere, efficient, inexpensive.

50,Great tapas,"We got there on Saturday evening at around 6:45pm and there was already a queue. We were told it would be over 1 hour wait.This restaurant is tiny and sits less than 20 people at a time. The tables are tiny and very cramped but the atmosphere and decor felt very authentic.The drinks option was relatively limited with rioja, sangria, beer, capriniha, mojito and soft drinks but was very reasonable. A small glass of rioja was 3 euros and sangria was 3.5 euros. The cocktails were 5/6 euros.The tapas menu offered 3 options:1. select tapas yourself2.29 euros for 2 ppl for chefs selection of 8 tapas (you can choose/specify if you prefer)3. 39 euros for 2 ppl for chefs selection of 8 tapas plus Iberico ham platterThe tapas options were on the chalk boards hung up but there was no translation/English. Or if you managed to nab one of the seats around the chefs table then all the tapas were set out on plates so you could look and point. There were no labels but you could ask the waitresses.If you order the chefs selection then you could specify if there was anything you want/didn't want (e.g. no cheese, more meat etc)We chose option 3 and got a Iberico ham platter (with some tomato bread and chorizo slices and cheese) and 2 rounds of 4 tapas. We said we eat everything but in retrospect we probably should have said less goats cheese.The service was good, food was yummy but felt like more could have been done to help tourists pick tapas. Perhaps a board with some English translation?Anyway, great place. If I went back again I would ask for more croquettes and less cheese!Show less","Reviewed May 27, 2017",Date of visit: May 2017

We waited about 40 min in line with two people in front of us, but the people behind us were seated almost at the same time, so it depends on the flow.The food is all reheated, which isn't to say it's bad, but it's drenched in sauces and cheese to hide the flavors and nothing to write home about. Maybe it was an off night but the service was also relatively inattentive, or maybe it's because we spoke English and there was a difference in communication styles. Ordered a second drink halfway through the meal and it never came - they did take it off the bill at the end when I asked though, and the servers were generally friendly. In any case, won't be coming back; too bad because it's a cozy space with potential. No music or anything also makes the silence and noise of the fan more awkward.Show less","Reviewed May 22, 2017",Date of visit: May 2017

Nothing I received was bad. But I did not have a single mouthgasm. It was good food, but I would not give it the hype it has.

If you are lucky enough to get a place at the bar, you will have the most amazing array of tapas laid out before you. You can choose to select individual tapas, or put your trust in the staff and order a set menu of eight tapas for sharing by two persons. It was plenty of food for my spouse and myself, and most items were delicious. One exception was a pork skewer that was a bit overcooked and dry. When we had finished our meal and our waiter saw we had barely touched that one item, she insisted we select another. The tomato and papas flan we selected as a replacement was wonderful.

20,High Ratings – but disappointing,"The TA high ratings brought us to this restaurant for presumably ‘the best tapas in Barcelona’… but that is not the case. We experienced several meals that were much better in other restaurants. We went for the 39.00 Euro ‘surprise’ sharing tapas for 2 – even though they asked us our likes and dislikes when we ordered, we were both underwhelmed with the quality and presentation of the food: very bready and cheese covered, meat overcooked, dry, bland and not enough seasoning, no wow-factor. We waited for 40 minutes in a narrow crowded entryway, where lighted candles were along the wall… while backing up against the wall to let guests leave through the corridor, my hair caught on fire from a candle on the wall. Obviously, health&safety risks are not adequately reviewed by management. After all the commotion and being beaten on my head to get the fire out, the manager offered a bottle of wine to take to our hotel as a good-will gesture – I would rather hope the candles have been removed.Show less","Reviewed April 27, 2017",Date of visit: April 2017

50,Fantastic restaurant tucked out of the way,"Slightly off the main streets but within 5 minutes of Las ramblas this small restaurant has only a few tables but serves wonderful tapas. Having read the reviews on TA we wanted to try tapas and Bodega Biarritz did not disappoint. Waiting staff were very friendly and patient explaining all the options and dishes, especially our waitress Rosy. Although family friendly our son who is a bit picky did not like the chicken (slightly spicy) or home made burger (its got carrots in it) so not really for small children or picky eaters. Of the 12 - 16 tapas we tried all were tasty and 2 or 3 were heavenly especially the chicken, chorizo and zucchini stack. Will definitely return again as not only was it great but the price was reasonable too.Show less","Reviewed April 10, 2017",Date of visit: April 2017

It's very quirky, we still had to wait, but hardly a challenge in warm weather, drink in hand down a little street in the Gothic Qtr. It's certainly a different way of serving, either let them pick tapas off the bar for you (of you're not a picky eater this could be quite fun surprise way of eating), or like us (husband doesn't eat pork, I don't eat eggs) we have the waiter explain all the dishes then we pick some to be heated. I loved this tiny restaurant, wine was good too.They only take cash, and by the time we left the was a decent queue of people waiting (and it's like this every night). Ps they don't take reservations and there's a larger sister restaurant on the same street a few hundred yards away you can try if you can't get in and the wait is too long.

It's not a place where you can take your time as they want you to make your selection quickly. Also they don't do just drinks. Cash only too.

50,An accidental find,"A late afternoon walk around the gothic quarter of Barcelona, I fell upon this little gem. Little being a good word to describe this small tapas bar as it must only have about 20 seats but I was lucky to find it as it was opening and it was empty. The bar has two rules, firstly it does not accept cards so it is cash only and secondly, they will only serve you a drink if you order food.So let's talk about the food.... the bar top is covered in plates of various dishes (Think of Basque Bars!). The owner and staff (especially the French waitress, Orlane who speaks perfect English and if very friendly) are passionate about the food and explain they open at 5pm because they spend the previous 7 hours cooking the food. The food is in one word, wonderful. Now the shock horror... you pick the food to be warmed up and rather then being nuked in a microwave it is warmed up the old fashion way in the oven. Dishes are served as the get to temperature which spreads out the time giving you more chance to drink. The dishes are served and garnished as if they are a course of a tasting menu in a top restaurant. Ingredients are fresh and meat is moist. Tortilla with pesto is fresh and the chicken stacked with numerous vegetables filling.On the Saturday night I had this fantastic idea of a revisit but unfortunately the queue outside confirmed the popularity of the bar and I had to dine elsewhere. If you can find the place and the queue isn't very long, this is a good place to try.Show less","Reviewed January 13, 2017",Date of visit: December 2016

I will begin with the staff, which is very polite and always willing to help. We would like to thank ORLANE for her attitude and her smile. She really helped us a lot with the various tapas. The food is very good and delicious. There are several options for ordering. I suggest Option 2, which offers Jamon Iberico together with bread covered with olive oil as a starter and then a series of tapas which are all very tasteful. Every time they bring something, they explain in detail the ingredients and if you do not like something they can take it back and bring something different. One thing that impressed me is that they ask if there is any health problem related to allergies etc. The place is small but the atmosphere excellent and for sure I recommend it. If you go, try also their Sangria wine. Just perfect!Show less","Reviewed December 16, 2016",Date of visit: December 2016

She makes us feel at home and helped us with our choices of the best tapas. She also surprised us with the choice of Spanish Wine. Place is clean.

We waited around 30 minutes but we got chatting to some lovely people outside and so the 30 minutes passed quite quickly. We were seated at a 'very small' table (really, it was a half table' )but that didn't matter as the atmosphere was fabulous. The waiter quickly sat us down and gave us a menu. You could choose from a set menu or choose your own tapas. We went for the option to choose our own. We were advised that the tapas had been pre-prepared and that it was simply heated up. I was a little sceptical at first but the food was amazing, this alongside the young lady who was very attentive.

The waiter took the order for the drinks right away, then I had to chose the food for everyone and the waiter prepared then the plates and warmed the food, which is not common here. Really good presentation of the food, everything was made of fresh products and the food was warmed up. Perfect! As for the drinks, the mojitos were very good, the sangria was so-so. The owner speaks french, et il ne parle pas comme une vache espagnole comme dirait sa femme. The only thing to improve would be not to rush people to eat. And we felt a little bit narrow as it is a very small place. Not good for groups or for children. As for the prices, tapas are between 1.5€ and 4€ if I am not mistaken and it totally worth it.

The Option 2 tasting menu (they pick out 8 tapas, you eat them) was simply fantastic...they have a great system whereby if you don't like something, they change it, no questions asked....it wasn't needed but was good to know.

50,Amazing and authentic tapas - a great find,"The outside of this place doesn't do justice the food they serve inside. Don't be put off by the sign asking you to wait - it's just because there's not enough room in there for people to hang around!Food is amazing, you can either choose dishes yourself from the large selection out in front of you, or trust your waiter to do it for you - we chose the latter because we didn't really know where to start. I highly recommend this, we ended up trying new things that we loved - and probably wouldn't have chosen ourselves. My boyfriend and I are very much meat eaters and the veggie options might not have had a look-in, but they were my favourite! Such tasty food. Seriously, give it a go. It's really good value too.If you get there and there's a queue, don't worry too much coz they don't let people faff around drinking and talking for ages after they've eaten - once you're done eating you drink up and go, they don't serve drinks on their own.

50,Super eating,"What a clever idea Bodega Biarritz is. A tiny space with a fabulous selection of larger than normal tapas and great staff - a winning combination. It works like this:- you are first brought to high seats against the back wall where the menu is explained by a friendly staff member- there are 3 main options: i) have a look along the full choice of tapas set along the bar and pick what you want; ii) let the staff choose 8 selections for you at a fixed price of 27 euros; iii) same as previous with breads for 2 for 37 euros. We opted for option ii).- when the tapas are ready you move across to the main bar area and sit in a line with the other customers, being fed a few tapas at a time. Everything is explained by the staff.The food is beautiful and it is a very sociable way to eat. 8 tapas shared (they are quite large) were enough for us, but other customers added a few more choices. All the food is visible, so it is a case of trying what you like. Drinks are very reasonably priced.Overall, we found this to be one of the most pleasant surprises during our time in Barcelona.

I wasn't too busy when I arrived and waited approx 5 mins and found seating area at the bar. The place is quite small and located very close to Placa Reial. I stayed here for almost an hour and had good mojito drink. Great tapas choice and got some recommendation for the staff worked here and their absolutely delicious.Very friendly staff and excellent value for money. I would come back here again!!Show less,"Reviewed October 23, 2016",Date of visit: September 2016
40,Best place to eat in Barcelona Gothic Quarter,We had the chance of having our friends with us who had the experience of eating here. I'm glad they did insist on having dinner in this place as it was slightly different from other Tapas places where we were before as you should walk along the bar (waiter on the other side) while picking up your tapas in order for them to heat them up and serve them to you. It was very small place and cozy and surely we waited about half an hour to be seated. Itw as worth the wait.Show less,"Reviewed October 21, 2016",Date of visit: October 2016
40,A little gem!!,"This very small but cosy and traditional tapas bar in the centre of Barcelona (close to La Ramblas) made our weekend in this delightful city an experience to remember.

30,Disappointed - big change from last visit,"We returned here last weekend after being here twice on our visit last year and loving it. We were really looking forward to it but have to say we were quite disappointed.It felt much more of a ""hard-sell"" this time, with menus being pushed at us and being urged to spend on the different ""deal"" menus. The tapas we had were lovely to be fair but were quite similar and quite stodgy. The sangria wasn't great at all & I left it after 2 sips & got a beer. Not much selection here tho, only one available.Overall we felt that the whole experience was rushed & that we were being pushed through in order to get more people in. Might not be the case to be fair but it certainly feels like it.Also, the staff were all different to our last visit & the overall experience was nowhere near as enjoyable.Very disappointed compared to last year & unfortunately we won't be coming back.Show less","Reviewed October 19, 2016",Date of visit: October 2016
40,After 7 you might need to queue/lovely staff/tasty Tapas,"PROS: v warm friendly staff; great ambiance; nice music; well priced - we went for the set menu for 2 (8 tapas)...less than €30 (think it was €27...sorry left receipt there) - with 5 alcoholic drinks it was €42 & more than enough food; the food was mostly delicious...CONS: there's only about 24 seats & it's popular (maybe due to all these good reviews?) so if you get there after 7 you might need to queue; we loved the Tapas to start, however became a bit heavy on the cheese & pastry toward the end.TO SUM UP: they do say to let them know if you prefer something different to what they're offering on the 8 Tapas deal but a bit hard to tell until you start eating it + it was also hard to see what else was on offer. If we went again we wouldn't do the 8 Tapas deal - we would choose the first 4 (a tortilla, a vegetable stack with eggplant etc, a quiche, 1 pastry/chorizo Tapas). The next 4 were all too similar & heavy on pastry/cheese in our opinion although some may love that? However, a very pleasant night so we would recommend a visit. There's quite a few signs with ""No seafood""; ""No Credit Card""; ""No... - a bit off putting to start but I suppose because they're doing so well they can set the rules and there's no point complaining as you can read it all while you're queuing! I've never quite seen anything like it! All v interesting and we wish them well - nice people who seem to genuinely enjoy what they're doing. They all speak about 3 languages too - they wear badges to show what languages they speak. All seemed to speak English.Show less","Reviewed October 18, 2016",Date of visit: October 2016

50,Great tapas bar,"Unlike most tapas bars, this place controls crowd entry and exit. It was a long wait before we got in (about 45 mins). But it was worth it.First, the crowd control ensures that you enjoy a nice pleasant evening of food and drinks.But then, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. The tapas are awesome and refreshingly different. I had albondigas, garlic chicken skewers, lomo iberico, and goat cheese with mushrooms - all were very good!Of course, what is a tapas bar worth going to if the drinks are no good? Sangria and mojitos - I had 2 of each!Also worth mentioning is the eclectic yet closely knit staff the provides excellent service.Stephanie (French) is the owner but is totally hands-on in ensuring her guests have a memorable experience.Hats off to Kareen (Filipino), Nicholas (Filipino), and Mini (Indian) for making us feel at home and providing swift, excellent service!Lastly, I found out that a 2nd Bodega Biarritz will be opened next year.

40,Tasty food in a cosy setting,"We visited Bodega just 10 days ago, and had a lovely meal with very tasty tapas.After a lovely sunny Sunday, the skies opened and we had to queue in the rain for about 20 minutes. We could have left, of course, but it all kind of added to the charm of this small blink-and-you'll-miss-it establishment found down a cobbled alleyway! And we had a glass of wine to warm our souls and keep us happy whilst we waited for the next table to become free - perfect! But we weren't the only ones queuing - 2 couples in front of us, and by the time we were seated, another 10 people outside!We sat on one of their barrel tables, small but charming, and which added to the overall atmosphere of the place.Tapas were very tasty, but very heavy on cheese & bread selections. They make this clear before you you even enter the restaurant (on an amusing blackboard to warn any coeliacs, dairy-intolerants etc), but even so, we were still hoping for a greater selection of meat and fish tapas that weren't encased in cheesy tortilla or bread. We ended up ordering an additional chorizo plate, just to counter all the carbs we'd been faced with (any excuse!)It was constantly busy, and we're glad we went here and experienced it. But strangely, for value & choice, it fell towards the bottom of our list by the time we'd left Barcelona (due in part to finding so many other lovely restaurants with amazing food)We'd certainly return, as the atmosphere was great, the food was good, and the experience was good fun all round - but might opt for just drinks and a light snack next time :)Show less","Reviewed October 4, 2016",Date of visit: September 2016

I am fussy and don't eat fish so we selected our own.The tapas was well presented and everything looked amazing! All big portions for tapas which was great allowing me and my husband to half most things to taste more.There was a good selection of meat tapas as well as vegetable tapas. Drinks were also good (including sangria).It is difficult to recommend specific items as it was all beautiful. After choosing you plate is warmed up and items brought when ready (things at different times so things stay warm).This was the best meal we had in Barcelona as the food was lovely and the atmosphere was also nice.

50,Delicious!,My husband and I chose to have dinner here based on the great reviews. It did not disappoint!This is a tiny tapas bar with a lot of character. There is no menu - the tapas are all sitting out on the bar and you can either point to what you want and they prepare it for you or else you can ask them to select dishes for you. We opted for the latter option and they prepared 8 dishes for us which were all lovely.Each time the waitress and waiters brought us more dishes they told us if we didn't like anything they would replace it with something else. I had never had this offer in a restaurant before!This is not somewhere to sit for a whole evening - we were in and out in no more than half an hour although we did not feel as though we were being rushed.

40,Brilliant little restaurant.,"We visited Barcelona in September and found this little gem of a restaurant. We did have to queue for about 20 minutes to get in as the restaurant has less than 30 seats and you are literally rammed in!All of this said, it has an amazing Spanish charm and had a feeling of authenticity. There is no menu, you simply stand up and point to the dishes you want that are on the bar. These are then brought to you once you've decided. You can stand up and pick as many times as you wish however new customers get a priority over you.This restaurant is brilliant and well worth a visit.

Tapas are put on a plate as you select them and then warmed/prepared for delivery to where you are sitting.

They are essentially a quarter table that you have to balance on a stool while eating. I couldn't use a fork and knife because there is no room for one arm to move.The staff is amazingly helpful and friendly. Can't say enough good things about them. While I generally find the service in Barcelona to be average at best, they were tops.The food was good, but very cheese dependant. There was cheese on everything. Jamon and patatas? Topped with cheese. Chorizo sandwich? Topped with cheese. If you like cheese you'll likely love it. If you don't like cheese you should probably stay away.

We set off from our hotel with the promise of 'authentic tapas', 'amazing vibe' and was thoroughly disappointed. Bearing in mind this was our last night we decided to wait 30mins to get in. I'd like to clarify the way the place works;- all food is pre cooked. Laid out on the side, you then choose what you like and they re heat it in a large microwave.....authentic? I think not- we had 7 dishes and 4 drinks for 45 euros, which may seem OK, but I was so gutted this was my last meal after the one I had the night before. There isn't a kitchen in the place. Tell me that's authentic. Please, don't waste your time or your money.In note, the service from the older gentleman and the young guy on the bar was great, warm and friendly.

If it is a quick meal you are after and you like the style of food it may be ideal. If however, you want a quiet relaxed dinner it is DEFINITELY not for you. It opens only for dinner at 5:30pm and is located in the Gothic Quarter of Barcelona and it is hard to find. It would be harder in the dark. It is in a narrow lane off the large market square - back right if entering from La Rambla. We arrived at 7:30 and it was the only restaurant in the area with a queue. The notice boards give a hint - no seafood, cash only. We waited 30 minutes but the friendly staff offered us drinks to fill the time. It is best to sit at the bar to watch the action. There are no menus - the choice of tapas is laid out on the bench and this changes daily. Chef recommends 8 dishes for a couple - 20 Euro p/p. You walk up and down to select - being our first time we left it to him. I would choose your own. It all arrived on a large serving plate within 10 minutes. This style of tapas is not my choice - Hi Carb - lots of potato/cheese/sausage but other patrons were really enjoying themselves. The house wine was good.However the vibe was - you leave after you have eaten.

50,Brilliant Tapas,"This tapas bar was very close to our hotel. We went very early as we noticed that it gets busy in the evenings (and people cue outside) and there are limited seating. It was very nice food, good service and the beer was ice cold. I let the waitress choose my tapas and it was all delicious.

50,Closed on Tuesdays and cash only,"The hours on Tripadvisor are wrong, as they aren't open on Tuesdays. We went on a Wednesday around 7.30pm and we able to get the last available table with no wait. The restaurant is very small, it seats maybe 10 people at the counter and has another three 2-person tables. They have a sign saying you can order drinks only with food and once you agree they have a person behind the counter walking you from right to left explaining what each plate is, so you can pick your tapas. The prices are what they're supposed to be around 2-3 euros for most dishes, the drinks are very reasonably priced as well. I highly recommend it for a true tapas experience.

The restaurant is very small but it makes you feel comfy and special. Service is proffesional so you get the most from this experience.

The food was incredible and it was such a unique experience! The tapas are already made and on display, when the bartender calls you up he tells you what is what and then you choose which ones to eat; they ready it up (heat it, add the toppings, sauces, etc.) put all your choices on a platter and bring them to your tiny table.

20,"Much better alternatives, overrated","We went here based on TA. It's very over rated. If you are a tourist and not used to the quality of food in Spain then maybe you'll like it and the atmosphere.But if you're used to eating in Spain you will definitely be disappointed by the quality of the food.The layout is similar to a pinxo bar in The basque country where you can see your small tapas/pinxo dishes and pick the one you want and you pay for it. But the quality is nowhere near to the basque quality.Choice is limited and reheated to order.I definitely wouldn't recommend this to anyone. The queue is due to TA and it being such a small place.The reason I didn't give it a terrible rating was that the service was OK.This is a big problem with trip advisor, you go on a recommendation and it's disappointing.Show less","Reviewed August 24, 2016",Date of visit: August 2016

40,Definitely must try,"The food is 5 stars. There is no technical menu but no fear. Some offerings are writing on the wall and you also get out of your seat and say yes or no to each menu item as your waitress points them out and explains them from the other side of the counter. The items are then staggered out so you can eat and have new items brought out every few minutes. It was a unique experience and the place is very lively. If you're coming with more than 1 other person, be prepared to separate. It's tiny and getting more than 2 seats together is hard. We got lucky and had 2 tables back to back which was nice since our other travel companions were our children. The wine and cocktails were good too. Fast service since they need to re-seat so if you want to a place to linger, this isn't the place for you.I took off one star for the cramp seats. We probably had the worst table in the restaurant though and others would probably be fine. My kids had a nice table. Our table consisted of 2 stools and a table about 8 inches wide by 15 inches long. Basically a legal size piece of paper. A fan was running close to my head so I had to switch seats with my husband because the waitress worried about my hair getting caught. My husband happily hunched over and sat. They could make some tables slightly bigger since there are bigger tables in the same aisle space and the fans could be replaced with something better and better located.Tip: the line seems to go faster than their sign states so don't jump ship too fast.

The first night we arrived there at 10pm (2200h) to a 1hr long queue so we came back the next evening at 8pm (2000h) and waited only 5min - and were allowed to order a sangria to drink in the queue.I would advise if you have a group larger than 2-3 this will be difficult because it's a very very small place.The food was incredible and came out much cheaper than we expected. (44€ for 9 tapas and 4 glasses of sangria).We took the chefs recommendation; he chose 8 tapas for us and they were all really delicious. If you do this option and don't like the look of a Tapa he will happily swap it to another one.Note: cash only. No gluten free.

After waiting ten minutes we were ushered to our seats which were right up against the wall and forced us to sit uncomfortably sideways to the table. We were encouraged to try the 8 tapas selection plates and were told that it would be €35 for the food and our two glasses of sangria. The ham and the tomato bread were tasty however the rest was very underwhelming and not worth the €45 bill we were finally presented with at the end!

We waited about 15 minutes and then said we were happy to split it to separate parties which meant some of us were seated first as lots of people were in twos. However once we were all in and some others left they reseated us so we were all close to each other. The restaurant has a long bar and then a few half barrels around the edge for seating.

40,Delicious tapas!,"Read all the reviews about this place and expected to arrive a log queue. Luckily we were inside and seated within 5 minutes.Kareen and the staff here were lovely. We opted for the random 8 tapas dishes chosen for us. It was delicious. Most of their dishes are potato/cheese based, so despite small plates of tapas it was extremely filling. Various meats and veggie dishes. Great but small restaurant.The one negative was it was extremely hot. Being so close to the kitchen (very narrow restaurant). That knocked one star off unfortunately! But heavily recommendedShow less","Reviewed July 29, 2016",Date of visit: July 2016

50,Great tapas in a friendly cosy surrounding,"Stopped off purely by accident and managed to get in (there can be queues). Lovely tapas and great service from huini . Not exactly comfortable seating means this is more of your quick snack and go type of tapas rather than a long drawn out affair ... this suited us and the tapas definitely lived up to the other reviews on here. Recommended, if a big group go early - don't expect to be all seated together and quite small inside.Show less","Reviewed July 29, 2016",Date of visit: July 2016

40,"Simple but good tapas, casual vibe","We went here based on TA reviews. We chose to eat earlier than normal, around 19:30 ish to avoid queuing. It was full when we got there but we only had to wait a few minutes. The place is very small and hot! The food is all laid out on the bar, you can either select your own or they choose a selection for you. We let them choose it but in hindsight we wished we'd have chose our own as we ended up ordering some of the others we fancied so left rather full. The food however was really great! I can't give this place 5* because it's so uncomfortable in there! You can't sit properly as you're around half barrels, the stools have no backs and it's really hot, so you feel like you're perched in a bar and it all feels a bit rushed. Fine if that's what you're after, but I prefer to relax a bit when I'm eating and it's definitely not that. I felt for the experience, it was overpriced, but the food was good, so if you're nt bothered about relaxing or comfort when you're eating, you'll like this place a lot! FYI, it's cash only and we spent around 55 EUR including drinks.Show less","Reviewed July 27, 2016",Date of visit: July 2016
50,Believe,"Had one night in Barca and wanted a real authentic experience. Yes, we did have to wait - took around half an hour to be seated but this was expected considering it was a Saturday night and having read other reviews. Staff were friendly and served up sangria as we waited at the front of the queue.Once we progressed past the rope and were seated to the side, we discovered this place is actually tiny with room for only about 25 people. We noticed food being prepared behind the bar in what quite cramped quarters.Waitress explained there was no menu, you just select what you would like from the pre made options on the bar or from the cooked to order options from the board. I made several selections and took the waitresses recommendation to try the local ham with tomato bread and the olives.After a short wait our food began to arrive. Every mouthful was a delight! Standouts were the chicken skewers and the mini toasted ham cheese sandwiches (not sure of the correct names?) Was difficult to stop we wanted to try everything!Hard to believe such amazing food could be produced in such a small kitchen.

In fact, I am not normally a mojito fan, but these drinks were incredible.You select from a range of tapas dishes displayed on the bar. The chefs prepare each dish with a side of vegetables and ensure they are heated before service.We found the ordering process quite unique in that, to order, all you need to do is stand up and point to the dishes you wish to order. We found this a refreshing spin on Spanish dining.You can also order as many times as you like.We found the experience to be similar to visiting a speakeasy bar; only limited spaces are available, and we felt like celebrities, only able to enter beyond the red rope.

The third party said they do not mind, they have ordered their drinks, then a table became free, another staff came and asked them if they want to come in or stay outside, of course they said they want to come inside. Myself and the second party asked what is going on? We are here before them and they have been offered the table before us? The staff told us some really lame excuses, she said in Spain it is illegal to serve food and drinks on the outside! I was thinking why did you offer them in the place? Not impressed, we complained, all the people inside were watching us. So the manager apologised and said he did not know. We got offered a free drink as a gesture of sorry. We did not expect anything, but it is nice for them to acknowledge the mistake and they have been apologising to us and the food is nice. If they could communicate better, I would give 5 stars.This place is quite small and you can not book in advance. You have to queue for a place. When it is busy, it is one out one in system, you have to wait till one place is free.

50,Best Tapas ever!!!,This is really the best place to eat authentic tapas in Barcelona. It's a hidden little gem in the middle of the small crooked streets of the gothic quarter. The owners run this little bodega by themselves and the team is very friendly too. We had dinner there twice because it was soooo delicious. We will definitely come back once we're in Barcelona again.Show less,"Reviewed June 24, 2016",Date of visit: April 2016
50,Wonderful little tapas restaurant in the heart of Barcelona,"We stumbled along this place in Barcelona, and we were so impressed! You have to queue for a while to get in, but it was definitely worth the wait. It is all tapas, and the tapas are spread out on the bar for you to see and select; however, you can see that they have made them fresh rather than them waiting out for a while! The selection is great, and the staff are very helpful, explaining all the tapas for you and guiding you through the selection process. We couldn't believe the cost as well- we had 6 tapas between 2, with 2 sangria each, and the total was €36! The only snag is that they don't accept credit card- tbh we didn't actually check if they took debit and we just got money out instead, but for the price, you can't complain! We will definitely be back.Show less","Reviewed June 20, 2016",Date of visit: June 2016

There's only about 20 seats in the place and we sat at the bar each night. The tapas is out on display on the bar and you select what you want, they heat it up and you enjoy it. If you get there at a busy time, you'll likely wait outside until a seat becomes available. We ate a bit earlier than the norm and missed any wait. Note, they only take cash.

50,To die for tapas.. if there is a queue its worth the wait!,"My husband had done his reseach on trip advisor earlier on in the day, and his 30 minutes of quietness was certainly worth finding this gem. We strolled through the busy streets and came across the sign. We were a little disappointed to see a small queue beginning to form outside, but decided to wait as the reviews were so good. Also a girl left and gave us the thumbs up and told us to carry on waiting. It wasn't long that we were seated on 2 stools at the end of the bar (All the seating is on wooden bar stools and along the high bar and on small crescent shaped tables- therefore it makes it difficult to eat together if you are any more than a couple in a group)We were left on our own for abit to marvel over the delights that sat before us on the bar.. I took a walk up and down the bar to look at the wonderful food. The concept is that you basically tell the waiter what you want, and they pick it up, pop it on a plate and heat it up in a mini oven for you, Don't be fooled that the food isn't enough to fill you. I think we ended up having about 12 things between us:highlights for me were the ham croquettes -wasn't keen on the cod ones, but all the others were lovely.A tomato based round tart, goats cheese on a rosti, chorizo sausage. In fact all of them were delightful and I could have kept eating all night, if it wasn't for the fact im pregnant and cant eat as much as I used to.my husband had sangria which was tasty and fruity and I had a bottle of water.What I liked about this place compared to another one we went to is that there wasn't any bread in sight!for 12 items and 2 drinks we paid 47 euros.really worth the wait!! very busy little place and very authentic.thumbs up!Show less","Reviewed June 2, 2016",Date of visit: May 2016

I would suggest getting there early as we saw waits that were about an hour long when we came by around 8:30/9pm. The prices range from 1.50 to 4 euro, making it very affordable.

The food is so tasty, and lots and lots of choice. You can always choose more as well. The drink are so nice, sangria was delicious!! Staff were very friendly and made it a nice experience!!! It is only small and you sit on bar stools either at the bar or around barrels, it looked a bit uncomfortable around the barrels but sitting at the bar was fun! Would highly recommend this tapas bar!Show less","Reviewed April 19, 2016",Date of visit: April 2016

30,I had great expectations,"The sangria was absolutely baller but the food itself was just alright. Croquets were OK (we tried the meat and the mushroom croquets). Portions overall were quite small, ~3€ each. Mostly tourists here, you can probably find better tapas elsewhere.","Reviewed April 16, 2016",Date of visit: April 2016
50,Best meal so far!,"We decided to try what many tripadvisor reviewers have raved about! We were not disappointed. We had a little wait because it was still quite early. Had we gotten a there 15 minutes later, it would been a much longer wait. The line built up pretty fast. The place was very small but cozy. There was great music, at least for me. There was a great variety of tapas. Loved the garlic and spiced chicken and the chorizo!!! The sangria was great. The owner was very nice but she was rather strict. :-) would definitely go back and recommend to friends.Show less","Reviewed April 15, 2016",Date of visit: April 2016
50,Amazing little place,"My boyfriend and I were staying very close to here and noticed there was always a big queue to get inside. We checked out the menu earlier today and decided to come back a little later as we weren't so hungry just yet. When we came back the staff remembered us which was already very welcoming.The interior is very snug and there's a warm ambience. We were sat up at the bar where all the food was laid out, which I really liked but there are also some tables made of barrels away from the bar if you preferred. Our drinks orders were taken promptly (we had two sangria). There is ample choice of tapas both meat and vegetarian (ranging in price from roughly 2e-4e) which suited us perfectly as I do not eat meat. They were super tasty, we ordered quite a few veggie ones and my boyfriend ordered some meat ones which he also really enjoyed.We got seconds after seeing some other diners choices and wanted to try more. The staff are super helpful and friendly and the whole experience felt very authentic. Our bill came to 50euro in the end which included three cocktails and seconds! We felt what we got was value for money considering food we had eaten on previous nights, that in comparison were overpriced.I loved the small seating arrangement and low lighting but I'm guessing it's not for everyone. Also I recommend going around 6pm as queues start to form pretty soon after.Show less","Reviewed April 15, 2016",Date of visit: April 2016

10,Not a place for trying Tapas,"Almost all small portion tapas are charge for 4 Euro, so trying a few will cost a lot.

10,Much overpriced very average tapas place,"First very uncomfortable sitting place. Have a peek before you go in so be sure you can accept that.Second, very average taste tapas. They are made of mainly cheese, tomatoes, potatoes. Nothing special about either the taste or the ingredients. The main meat tapas are grilled chicken stew, chilli pork skew and sausage.There are about 20 choices, the most majority of them are actually €4 pounds, although it says tapas prices from €1.5 to €4. A small bottle of water (€0.27 in supermarket) charged €2.5, ridiculous!!For two of us plus 3 year old spent €52, really came as a shock.We compared this with a proper dinner at a decent restaurant at port side the previous night, which cost the same. But for that one, we had all seafood, including two large seafood dishes, one large portion of starter and 3 teas. In case you wonder, it is ELX, Maremagnum shopping centre local 9.So we honestly think Bodega Biarritz is overpriced place with nothing special. Not worth visiting or waiting.Show less","Reviewed April 11, 2016",Date of visit: April 2016

Only managed to get a table on our 3rd night in Barcelona.The place was so small which can only fit about 7-8 couples. The tapas were appetizing and ranges from €2-€4 per tapas.

50,Best tapas bar in town,"We read about this place, here on Tripadvisor and decided to give it a go. We arrived at 9:50 PM and there was a small line outside. It is a very small tapas bar (only a bar and some small tables) but that is what gives it it's unique atmosphere. We waited outside for about 40 minutes before we could be seated. The last 10 minutes of waiting, we could already order some drinks (housemade mojito's and caipirinha!!) All tapas are presented at the bar and you have to order there. Then they bring you the tapas you ordered. Meanwhile you can order drinks (good selection of spanish wines). These were by far the best tapas we ate during our stay in Barcelona: real authentic and delicous food for a very reasonable price (1,5-4 euros per tapa). So although there is a big chance that you have to wait in line, we recommend this place to all who want to experience eating tapas as it should be.Show less","Reviewed April 8, 2016",Date of visit: April 2016

40,A different kind of Tapas,"With endless Tapa places in Barcelona, Bodega was sure unique in every which way.Based on service alone this place deserves 5 stars but with the limited food options and non table cloth along with semi self serve I'll have to give it 4.The spicy chicken satay/on stick was the best.They don't accept credit cards so do carry cash. It houses 10-12 tables so either go earlier or be prepared for a 25-40 min wait which to me was totally worth it.They have English speaking staff so language will not at all be a problem (if English is your first language).You are seated and can order drinks. The house Rioja wine was great. You are then asked to wait until the server comes get you and walks you to the food display. You can from there on select the tapa and amount as per desired. They keep making them fresh but the ones you select are the ones you'll be getting at your table after they have been heated up in the oven or over the grill.Overall it's a fun wall in the whole restaurant, great for any one looking to eat at the gothic quarter.Show less","Reviewed April 6, 2016",Date of visit: April 2016

We decided to walk down the alleyway at the bottom corner of Place de Reial and found Bodega Biarritz.It is a small place but it fills up very quickly because of what is on offer. The beers and cocktails are excellent and the food is superb tapas.Everything on offer was just to our tastes and the portions were of a good size to share.I just loved the ambiance and the style of this little place.

30,Do good things come to those who wait?,"This was the question on my mind as I entered this cosy, quaint and inviting establishment. We had waited a good 30 minutes in a queue, so naturally i wondered whether the food would justify this popularity. The answer is that we were by no means blown away by the food, but the overall experience was enjoyable. There is a good selection of tapas, on display at the bar; you go and choose your tapas which is then warmed up and served, so it is not cooked to order. Even so the service is efficient and friendly. Price is around 15/ 20 euro per head.

50,Amazing cheap tapas- great little place,"We went here after reading up on the best cheap/not too expensive tapas places to eat at, and this place definitely lives up to all the great reviews left.First of all, you may want to get there early, we were lucky as there was no queue but soon built up after we sat down. The place is tiny, I mean really tiny, you either sit up at the bar, or at the handful of large barrels (only big enough to sit two at) that are pushed up against the wall. If you are looking to go out as a large group, this probably isn't the place to go, as there are no proper tables unless you can all squeeze up at the bar.The food is already laid out on the bar and you basically point at what you want and they'll cook it up for you, even though everything is already pre-cooked and essentially reheated up, it's great tapas, really great tapas.There's loads to choose from and you can just keep ordering and ordering and ordering. They are happy for you to just sit there as long as you like and you easily can as I wanted to work my through everything they had.This place is a hidden gem and you can easily just walk past and think it's just another street food place, but you definitely need to go here. The restaurant is definitely a tight squeeze and a bit cosy but it all adds to the atmosphere and setting.Just go and order everything, you won't be disappointed.Show less","Reviewed October 25, 2015",Date of visit: October 2015
50,Secret little gem in the heart of the Gothic Quarter,"Accidentally came across this little tapas bar in the Gothic Quarter, very small, quite insignificant at first sight, but that changed after my experience. A little place filled with positive vibes given by the staff and the great food it offers. I let myself on the hand of the waiter, who served me a tapas of 5 different things, all of them being delicious (chicken, aubergine, goat cheese, spinach etc.) accompanied by ice-cold rosé wine. The waiter was a kind, passionate guy, doing his job singing and dancing, while still paying attention to everything what was happening in the crowded little place. The waiter, the bartender and a cook (or a helper) worked together on preparing the food and on serving the guests. The whole place had a bohemian atmosphere.I highly recommend the place to everyone wanting to taste a bit of the genuine Barcelona.Show less","Reviewed October 22, 2015",Date of visit: October 2015

40,"Very nice little Tapas place, real comfort food.","First thing you should know- if you're thinking of coming here, arrive early, because the place is small and it becomes packed in a matter of minutes. It becomes very easy to see why- nice Sangria, reasonable prices and food adorning the counter like some incredible, edible house decoration.The sheer range of food is excellent; from courgettes with ricotta to chicken skewers to stacks of chorizo and potatoes, you're guaranteed to find something that everyone will like. The people who work there are as warm as the top of the counter you're seated at, friendly and happy to give any of their personal recommendations.With this in mind, I come to the one drawback of the place. First, how cramped everything is. Others might call it 'cosy', and there is something nice about rubbing shoulders with visitors and locals alike, I have to admit. But when you're hanging off the counter and you look like you're performing surgery when eating, you know something is a little off.But if that doesn't bother you, then it's definitely worth a try. Between four of us, having ordered 17 tapas, 5 cocktails and 2 beers, the price came to just over 90 euros, which we thought was pretty reasonable. Just be prepared to come with an appetite, as you'll most likely want to try a little of everything!Show less","Reviewed October 16, 2015",Date of visit: October 2015

Each cost a few euros and they would heat it up for you and serve it once you selected what you wanted.

40,BRING CASH!!!!,"Went and tried this place our last night in Barcelona. The reviews indicated it had great food and drinks and they weren't wrong. It's a small restaurant but we went early (7:30pm is early in Barcelona) and were seated promptly at the bar. I highly recommend sitting here as you get to watch the kitchen and it's a little roomier than the seats on the wall. That's when we noticed the ""No Credit Cards"" sign. I had only about 30 Euros on me so was completely focused on staying within that budget. We had a pitcher of Sangria (14 Euros) and four tapas that were priced between (1.50 and 4 Euros). They don't have signs telling you the exact prices for each of the tapas. A server grabs a plate and walks with you down the entire long bar of tapas and you just point out what you want. He gladly exactly explained in English what each of the tapas were. A turkey stuffed Zucchini and goat cheese puff pastry were my favorites. The meat stuffed potato was a little dry but good. I wish I could have tried more but the cash only policy caught me off guard since no reviews pointed to that. Fortunately the total bill only came to 27 Euros. Definitely worth a try!Show less","Reviewed September 19, 2015",Date of visit: September 2015

Tiny little bar, dimly lit with loads of tapas on the bar which you just pick from and they warm and serve.Food is delicious, all home made and fresh, and whilst portions are small, they are very cheap. We were both fully stuffed and had sank a few beers and hadn't broken €60.Staff are incredibly friendly, and really want you to enjoy the food.

50,Thumbs up!!,"We visited this bar three times during our stay in Barcelona. Really great tapas - you should start from the very local authentic tapas (ask the waiter) and continue with your preferences - meat or veggie. They rules of the bar - you must select three tapas (you can easily share with you friend/girlfriend etc), but after you try them you realize you can't stop and ready to take more and more.

From the outside it is probably somewhere we wouldn't have chosen to eat at, but don't be put off. The staff are extremely friendly and welcoming, accommodating everyone where possible despite this place being on the smaller size! There is a friendly, chilled atmosphere inside with service being laid back. You cannot go wrong with the 4 euro mojitos (some of the best we had in Barcelona) and as for the food...definitely the best tapas we found in Barcelona. If I had not read reviews I wouldn't have been sure on the procedure of this place though as it wasn't really fully explained. After choosing the various things you want, they are warmed up and brought over. There is a huge variety to choose from and we were spoilt for choice really. Luckily we were able to go up and choose more food again and again!

Fortunately, the wait was only about 20 minutes. The host came to us to see how we were doing every once in a while to chat. He kept us entertained during our wait.When we were finally seated, we were at the bar and the restaurant was pretty packed. He explained to us how the restaurant worked. After a couple minutes, the waitress came to serve us. All of the food is displayed on the bar. We went down the bar with the waitress explained what was being served. She explained each item that we asked about, then she put anything we decided we wanted on a plate. After we'd chosen what we wanted, she took the plates of our food to the cook to be plated. Everything was plated so nicely, and the food was delicious! I enjoyed our whole meal! We definitely ate with our eyes when we picked out food, so we were completely stuffed by the end of our meal!The only thing I didn't like was having to go behind people while they were eating to choose my food. It felt like it would be a little disruptive having people constantly standing behind you and pointing at the food to choose what they want. But I did really like the concept of being able to see all the food and getting to choose each item individually.It was really a great experience, and the food was delicious!

It was probably around 35 degrees celsius inside.Then we we're showed the different dishes, and were told the prices varied between 2-4 euros.We ordered around 10 pieces, and the food was below avarage. Some quite dry, and many of them tasted the same, like they just the same seasoning on everything.We had, in total, three beers and two glasses of wine, no desserts, and ended up spending 70 euros. We were shocked when we saw this. The bill was handwritten, and no prices we're displayed on the different foods, so there was no point in arguing either.

50,Amazing authentic tapas. Must not miss.,Finding good authentic tapas in Barcelona was fairly challenging. Along La Rambla most of the restaurants offer very poor attempts at traditional dishes. But tucked away just off Plaça Reial you'll find Bodega Biarritz 1881.We had read reviews on here so we thought we'd give it a go and we were not disappointed. The place is fairly small and only seats about 15 people so if you want to get down there do so early as it fills up very quick.The food is spread out along the bar and the incredibly helpful hostess is more than happy to explain each of the dishes in English or Spanish. The dishes themselves were simply amazing. I'd especially recommend the Catalan pie and various chorizo tapas they offer. If we'd had the time I think we could've tried everything twice.If you are looking for a genuine tapas experience in Barcelona then you must come here.Show less,"Reviewed July 4, 2015",Date of visit: June 2015
50,One of the best dining experiences I've had ever,"The moment I laid eyes on this tapas bar, I knew I had to come back (since it was closed when I first walked past it). Best decision ever. The place is rather small, but that's what attracted me as it looked so cozy and unpretentious from outside. You have to queue for seats, but it's not a problem at all as one of the staff (I don't know his name but he serves drinks and attends to queuing customers), and boy does he know how to handle waiting customers. He intentionally makes drinks skillfully as a ""show"", and even pokes fun at waiting customers, which is actually a brilliant move as it makes the wait more entertaining.Once you get seated, you are explained how the ordering works. I love the system. You order when it's your turn, and you ""pick and choose"" the food you want, with the most patient lady ever explaining to you what each dish is (even if you don't ask about it). Once you've selected the dish, they put the dish in the oven and make the dish even better than what was presented. They even add sauces and extra ingredients (at no charge). And of course, the food was absolutely delicious. The drinks were fantastic too. In fact, I appreciate how the sangria was made stronger than most others I've tried (I know this cos I tend to drink them fast, in light of the hot weather, and I actually felt light headed from the one they served).Once you finish your meal, the lady asks you if everything is ok, and makes you feel well taken care of. Even the chef serves you with a smile although his hands are always busy with the food. And finally, you get a sincere handshake from the gentleman who attends to the queuing customers.I left the place with a huge smile and a filled stomach. I shall definitely return.Show less","Reviewed July 3, 2015",Date of visit: July 2015

The waitress was very charming and helpful, taking us along the bar explaining the dishes and filling up a plate with those we chose.All in, for two platters full of tapas and two drinks each came to roughly 50 Euros.Highlights were the patatas bravas and the cheese and chorizo tortilla.A lovely way to finish off our trip.Show less","Reviewed June 26, 2015",Date of visit: June 2015
40,Good But Not Brilliant,"After all great the T.A. reviews we gave it a go. First thing you can't book so go early or queue for a long time. Second no credit cards. Only cash. There is a good variety of tapas vegetarian, chicken, pork and beef. Only seafood is calamares which is deep field in a heavy floury batter. Six rings for 2 euros. The sangria was excellent. The top red was 5 euros a glass and very good.it is best to order a big variety first to get things moving. The place is very small. A bit cramped. The staff are very helpful and the service is very good despite all that is going on. The quality of the tapas overall is good but not outstanding. The clientele is mostly tourists in their early twenties and I suspect not very savvy about tapas. Disappointing that there was no other seafood on the menu.The chicken wings were outstanding. The iberico ham was also very good.Show less","Reviewed June 25, 2015",Date of visit: June 2015

We got down at the Catalunya metro station and took a nice long walk through La Rambla to reach the place.Bodega Biarritz has a classic bodega look & feel. A cozy, nice little place which can seat a maximum of 20 - 25 people at the maximum at a time. We were three including our little son 4 years old.

Lucky because it took another 45 minutes or so before the first couple were let in from the queue that built up after us!Three gentlemen who were serving made it a very 'welcoming' and cozy experience for us. Each of them strived to make us feel comfortable and we felt we were taken good care of! And it was not easy with at least two dozen different dishes on the offer and a stream of orders coming in from each person in the restaurant! I wonder how can people be so professional, warm, effective and smiling at the same time!We tried as many dishes as we could and still did not cover it all. But each dish tasted great. And were served in such a way that we had them warm and there was not a moment of 'sitting & waiting'. Great food and lovely service!This is not the right place if you are taking a business guest out or if you are looking for a candle light dinner. Neither the right place for large groups who want to be served on a single table. But perfect place if your focus is great tapas, relaxed environment and good drinks.We loved our experience.

We tried the calamare, spanish tortilla, garlic chicken, pork kabob, a chorizo/tortilla combination and zucchini with chicken. All fantastic. The small bar has so much character and the service was top notch. You just can't go wrong here!Show less","Reviewed March 7, 2015",Date of visit: March 2015

50,"Brilliant tapas, bar. Highly recommended!!","My husband and I read the other glowing reviews and decided we would try this bar a couple of nights ago while on our honeymoon. It was our first proper Tapas experience in Spain and we were certainly glad we came to this bar. We were the first ones in there for dinner (we arrived just before 7pm I think) so sat in the corner and had a cocktail. We certainly felt lucky as later they had to rope of the bar once it reached capacity and some people had to wait. The food seemed so authentic and was so tasty. Apart from the obvious amazing food and drinks the stand out was the very kind staff. They patiently explained things to us in English and never made us feel rushed to leave despite the line up to get in. The other thing I noticed was how they attended to those waiting in line offering them a drink at the door while they waited, lucky for them there was quick enough turn over that they didn't seem to have too long of a wait. Thank you so much for a great first Tapas experience!! We highly recommend this establishment and would definitely return.Show less","Reviewed December 16, 2014",

Two of us walked along the line of food and asked for six of certain dishes to be readied for us and within five or ten minutes, the food was in front of us. Every dish was delicious. The range on offer was just great and I'd imagine there was something for everyone amongst their dishes.Considering how central this restaurant is and the quality of food on offer, we felt the bill was very reasonable and each of us said that if and when we return to Barcelona, we would head straight back to Bodega Biarritz 1881!Show less","Reviewed October 22, 2014",Date of visit: October 2014

You point out which ones you like to the nice lady and they will put your plate in a magical oven where things come out tasting delicious! Yes they warm up the food but its just part of the whole process. Things are sizzling and crispy by the time it gets to your table.2) Extras: I noticed you can order other things besides the ones that are on display. You can find this in a chalk board under ""especialidades espanolas"". You can order patatas bravas and other traditional spanish tapas food.3) Space: It is very small and has a dim light bar atmosphere. You can either seat along the bar or the little 2-person table.4) Service: AMAZING.

You cannot book and if you want to avoid queues then it is important to arrive fairly early ie before 7pm.The only possible criticism would be that the flavours of tapas were perhaps slightly bland relative to some of the best I have had.

Rather than choosing your food from a picture in a menu, it is actually laid out in front of you and then warmed in the oven so it's piping hot. The minimum cost for a dish is €1.50 and maximum is €4, so it's great value to boot.

They usually have a dozen or more to choose from, ranging from simple breaded and fried croquettes to more elaborate quiche-like creations. The price is reasonable but can still add up depending on what you get. Staff very friendly. The negative for me was the limited selection of 'authentic' tapas.

If you do not speak Spanish language, do not worry, the Bodega staff will explain you all the available dishes in English. Be aware that due to its small size you might have to wait outside for a place to seat when it is busy.Show less","Reviewed August 9, 2014",Date of visit: August 2014

This is a very, very good tapas bar that certainly looks the part both inside and also as you pass it on the street. The staff are polite, welcoming, and it is clear that this is a team effort to show the best of Bodega Biarritz so that visitors really enjoy the tapas experience and the accompanying drinks. As already stated a warm welcome is on hand and also friendly guidance about how to go about ordering. The range of well presented food is most impressive and very fairly priced.

They seat you and you must go along the bar and let the 'waitress' plate the items you would like to be warmed up. Once an item is off the bar, it is gone! There isn't a kitchen that will cook more of your favorite item, so grab it while you can!This was one of the better experiences we had in Barcelona!

50,A very special little place.,"After reading the reviews of tapas restaurants in Barcelona I knew we were going to eat here. It's not the easiest place to find so we searched it out the night before we wanted to eat. As mentioned previously, it's a very small bar and when it's full they put a lovely rope across the entrance. Don't be put off, you won't wait long. Just order a drink and wait. We sat at the bar and the tapas selection is all along the bar. When you are ready to order, the hostess will explain in English,French or Spanish what each tapas is. They are very cheap so have fun and order lots!! Then it gets prepared and given back to you. I can't remember all that we had except to say we loved it!!

50,Tricky to find but TASTY!,"Decided to have my last meal in Barcelona here based on TA reviews; did not disappoint! Bit tricky to find, even using the ""point me there"" feature of my TA app map but only because of the rabbit warren designed neighborhood off Las Ramblas. It it SMALL, we got the last ""table"" which was a barrel with two chairs, but it was right next to the AC unit which was greatly appreciated as it was 84F at 9pm.It's true, no menu but everything is on display on the bar. There were 4 people working but they have a system, one man, who speaks fluent English seats you & handles drinks & will explain the system (as in no menu, cash only, Tapas are no less than 1.75 but no more than 4 Euro per piece, etc.), the other 2 men clear dishes & produce clean dishes. The woman behind the bar is in charge of the Tapas, she speaks at least 3 languages fluently; she explained ingredients to me in English (even noting I cannot have this it is fish; I told the waiter I'm allergic to shellfish, he passed on the word, impressive, even if slightly incorrect!) When I returned to order a couple more pieces she was explaining the lot to a French family, en Francais, so I ordered my next bit en Francais & the rest of the evening was en Francais; she's also fluent in Spanish. Nothing they had that night had shellfish so we tried an assortment of the traditional Tapas. I believe their definition of tradition is pork & cheese - NOT a problem. The flavors were divine! Just go! They have a little velvet rope they pull across the door frame when they are full & they never answer the phone & don't take reservations; so just go & wait it out. (We waited a whole 4 minutes but in fairness somebody was walking out the door when we arrived, so well timed on our part) I'd say they can seat maybe 20 people at one time. 2 drinks & 10 pieces of Tapas was 42 Euros.I want to add that there was a family of 5 & a family of 4 (2 parents w/children all under the age of 13) all sat at the bar & seemed to enjoy themselves but logistically I had to give average ratings for large groups & business meals because it would just be physically impossible unless you were to rent out the whole place for your party of 20.If I wasn't leaving in the morning I'd go back!

We were not disappointed as the food was excellent. There is no set menu just loads of superb tapas laid out along the bar and ready to be warmed up / cooked as you require. The staff were charming, friendly and helpful - a really nice touch was the waiter filling our (white) wine glasses with ice to cool them before giving them to us.

50,Can't overstate how good it is...,"I read many good reviews of this restaurant before going but honestly it's so much better than a review could reveal. The food is excellent. For instance, Patatas Bravas, which are generally cheap fried potatoes covered in ketchup and mayonnaise everywhere else, were SO good here. A homemade spicy tomato broth over freshly fried potato pieces and a little drizzle of mayo. The way they're intended to be. EVERY item we had was fresh, hot, well made and incredibly tasty. The sangria is easily the best we had in Barcelona.Then there's the staff. The owners (both seen in pictures here) are incredibly nice and have clearly trained their staff to treat people like they were in their home. They go out of their way to explain how to order, what's in each item, how much you can expect to spend, etc.Honestly easily one of the top two places we visited in Barcelona without a doubt.

The chef/owner was very friendly and makes one of the best Bombas I've had. All the food was very flavoursome and some tapas had a touch of French flair due to his wife being French.

We got the attention of the waitress, who puts all your food as you choose it on a plate and then whips it away to be heated. We had about 10 different tapas, all which were very tasty. Cheap price, good food, fun music, friendly lovely staff - would recommend and highly likely to go back.Show less","Reviewed October 10, 2013",Date of visit: October 2013
20,Despite all reviews here: this is a tourist trap..,"(24y, 25y couple one of us lived in spain for 9y)We visited this place because of the many excellent reviews on tripadvisor.The place looked very nice and the staff very friendly and helpfull, and offered us a glas of red wine while waiting for a place.The tapas looked fine, but after the first bite you could tell it was made from a pouder mixed source. After having 7 poor tapas I told my girlfriend to have some serano jamon and manchego cheese cause you can hardly go wrong with that.. Sad to say the pieces were drenshed in oil and not fresh. The jamon was just from the supermarket..It might be a good place for tourists who dont have any spanish experience and want to eat cheap and a variety of mediocre/bad tapas..Show less","Reviewed October 10, 2013",

Arriving in Barcelona it's hard to find somewhere authentic and great to eat! This place is it! Located just off la rumblas which is very dense in tourist restaurants and pick-pocketers. It's worth locating this little gem. So many places in this area have pictures of food in the window and have that very plastic feel..... This place has no menu the food is cooked and presented in front of you which the friendly staff can explain or advice..the food is then represented with garnishes etc, the wine is fantastic and extremely well priced, we are visiting for ten day and have been now to several restaurants but have decided to return here for our last also!

All the tapas options are laid out on the bar for you to browse. The staff were very friendly and helpful and would explain what each dish was (in English). The food comes fast as it's mostly pre cooked. All the tapas we ordered was great, but the stand out was the cod croquettes. As others have noted, their mojitos are very good; sangrias were average.

50,A Must!!,"We found this place on Trip Advisor, and stalked the streets of the Gothic Quarter with our Google Map guiding the way til we found it. My other half was a bit reprehensive as it was so small and didn't exactly look like a restaurant, but I suggested having a drink and a little nibble and we could go on elsewhere after... WELL... We both ate and ate til we could eat no more! Everything was so tasty and the whole setup felt very authentically Spanish - unlike a lot of other tapas bars in the area. I would recommend Bodega without hesitation for a delicious and atmospheric meal! You come away feeling you've had a real taste of Spain. The staff were also very friendly and helpful. The only negative I could mention is that the pricing is not exactly made clear, although this is only a problem if your eyes are bigger than you belly, like us! We just kept ordering more! Our bill was quite a bit more than we expected but by no means did we feel it wasn't worth every penny and we did eat A LOT so we were very satisified!

50,Fantastic little family run place,"We went here after finding it on Trip Advisor and were pleased that we did. It is a wonderful little family run place that is exactly the sort of place you would hope to find in the City (and are largely absent from the centre of london)It was a bit hard to find initially, however when we did we were offered a warm welcome and got a seat immediately. We did go early by Spanish standards (around 8:30) and while it did get busy, people did not generally wait long for a seat.All of the food is laid out on a long bench, where there are seats and there are also tables and seats around the outside. The food all looks great, then you go and select what you want along with some items on a menu and it is then cooked and brought to you. Everything that we had was delicious and the only problem was that I was too full to eat everything I wanted. You can see everything being cooked as the kitchen is open, and often the food is brought by the chef.The staff were really helpful and friendly and they all appeared to be family as they were even posing for photos at the request of some diners.Only issue was that the beer (Estrella) was more expensive than usual at 5 euros a pint, although the food is all reasonable, as were other drinks.Definitely worth a visit!Show less","Reviewed September 11, 2013",Date of visit: August 2013

I think this adds to the liveliness of the restaurant, although at busy times you might have to wait a few minutes for a table to come up. You order from a large range of small tapas dishes on the bar. The food is superb - the best tapas we had in Barcelona by a long way. It's very authentic Spanish food and good quality meats - unlike what you find in many of the kitsch tapas restaurants around the rambla area.

The cab driver could only drop us on LAs Ramblas and we walked the last two short blocks.While I don't think the food deserves five stars, I do think this small, family run and operated business deserves to be patronized, so I gave it five to keep it near the TA top of list.We had a blast and enjoyed everything we tried…..unusual with my two kids in tow.Important to note they are cash only.Show less","Reviewed August 18, 2013",Date of visit: August 2013
50,Great tapas bar close to flamenco show,"We spent a night on La Rambla and wanted to go to the Show Flamenco Los Tarantos in the Placa Reial just off the La Rambla. The Placa is just about half way down to the left if heading south on La Rambla. We wanted to keep everything as simple and convenient as possible. So we purchased our tickets for the Flamenco Show on the internet for 8 euros per/person. It is 10 euro at the show We went to the 8:30 pm show. The show only lasts about 45 minutes but gives you the flavor of the dance. I highly recommend buying the tickets ahead of time because when we got to the show location there was about 10 people in line but when they opened the doors at 8:00 pm they asked if anyone in line had tickets and we went right in and had first choice of a seat for the show. We had dinner before the show at Bodega Biarritz 1881 and the choices of the tapas were varied and tasty. The Bodega Biarritz is just off the Placa Reial. It is only a minute away from the Show Flamenco Los Tarantos which is in the Placa Reial.Also, if you want low cost drinks after the show there is an Irish pub just off the north side of the Placa Reial. Local beer was only 1.75 euros and a glass off wine was 2.75 euros. We paid 25 euros for a large beer and glass of wine on La Rambla earlier in the day.

The best, most friendly service we've probably had in Barcelona.

The staff spoke English well and were helpful in telling us what everything was. You go up to the bar when ready and you order whatever you would like ... kinda in a buffet style ... the food is all there laid out in front of you and then they heat it all up and bring it over on a platter. Kinda like getting to make your own appetizer platter. The only problem with this way of ordering food is we never find it to be warm enough ... usually they just pop it into a microwave so the middle tends to be cold. We had meatballs, a couple different types of crocketts and a catalan egg dish. The best thing was the mushroom crockett.If you are looking to eat were the locals eat, this is not the place ... they do do local food but the feeling is pretty touristy.
