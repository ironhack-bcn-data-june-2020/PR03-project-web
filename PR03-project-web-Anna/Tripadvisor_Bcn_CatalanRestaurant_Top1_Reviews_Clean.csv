0, 2013,4,28,4,We'd go back to Barcelona just for this food!!,"This little family run tapas bar was the best thing we have ever stumbled upon! It was unfortunate that we only discovered it on our second last day in Barcelona but we ate there twice and were not disappointed!We enjoyed the intimate atmosphere and the lovely owners. The sangria and the tapas were a lot more authentic and far tastier than anything that was marketed to the tourists on the Las Ramblas strip! It's very easy to find up a little alleyway next to the Placa Reial which is off the Las Ramblas. We would definitely recommend getting in early to get a seat at the bar. You won't be sorry. All the food was amazing but some of our favourites were the mushroom croquettes, chorizo (which comes with a side of patatas bravas) and the spicy skewered chicken. We have posted a picture also but seriously try everything!

2, 2013,6,1,5,Not bad but not amazing,"We went to this little restaurant last night. It was relatively easy to find and we grabbed a table in the corner pretty easy as well ( we went around 9pm). The staff spoke English well and were helpful in telling us what everything was. You go up to the bar when ready and you order whatever you would like ... kinda in a buffet style ... the food is all there laid out in front of you and then they heat it all up and bring it over on a platter. Kinda like getting to make your own appetizer platter. The only problem with this way of ordering food is we never find it to be warm enough ... usually they just pop it into a microwave so the middle tends to be cold. We had meatballs, a couple different types of crocketts and a catalan egg dish. The best thing was the mushroom crockett.If you are looking to eat were the locals eat, this is not the place ... they do do local food but the feeling is pretty touristy. Not a bad place but I would say nothing special and we would choose something different the next time.Show less",went little restaurant last night relatively easy find grabbed table corner pretty easy well went around 9pm staff spoke english well helpful telling u everything go bar ready order whatever would like kinda buffet style food laid front heat bring platter kinda like getting make appetizer platter problem way ordering food never find warm enough usually pop microwave middle tends cold meatball couple different type crockett catalan egg dish best thing mushroom crockettif looking eat local eat place local food feeling pretty touristy bad place would say nothing special would choose something different next timeshow le,202,100

5, 2013,6,25,4,Nipped in for a drink...... 4 hours later... fabulous!,Passed this little tapas bar just of Placa Reial Barcelona by chance. Initially we were just going to have a drink and a snack as we planned on eating out later that night. It was daylight when we went in this place and dark when we came out!!!! It was wonderful.The only problem with this place is its not big enough it could probably only seat about 20 people max so you would either have to wait or get lucky like us and find some seats. Saying that its sooooo worth it and maybe the size is part of its charm. The little tapas snacks were amazing and varied and ran the whole length of the bar. The waitress was very happy to explain what each one was to help you choose and they are cooked right in front of you. They have a nice range of beers and wines and the atmosphere is laid back and relaxed.Show less,passed little tapa bar placa reial barcelona chance initially going drink snack planned eating later night daylight went place dark came wonderfulthe problem place big enough could probably seat 20 people max would either wait get lucky like u find seat saying sooooo worth maybe size part charm little tapa snack amazing varied ran whole length bar waitress happy explain one help choose cooked right front nice range beer wine atmosphere laid back relaxedshow le,159,82

9, 2013,7,15,4,Excellent affordable tapas in a cozy setting,"This place is on a small street off the large square in the gothic quarter. Pretty easy to just pass it by - but that would be a mistake! We were 4 adults and 4 children, and were seated quickly by the lady behind the bar. The place is small, and we sat at the bar. The food is laid out on the bar so you can pick and choose what you like. Great choices for vegetarians as well. The food was excellent and probably the best tapas we had in Barcelona (some in our group say in Spain, but I think there was a place in Begur that was way up there). We had a few drinks and several tapas (more than prudent, perhaps) and it was not expensive at all. All the tapas were about 2 euro or thereabouts. The burger was disappointing - but other than that the food overall was excellent. Their mushroom croquettes were especially memorable.

17, 2013,7,4,4,Superb tapas served by passionate chef & owner,"Brilliant selection of tapas, all made by the owner who's family has been running this place for generations. Ask for the house specialty and you'll hopefully be shown the superb goats cheese filo pastry or the stuffed potatoes with minced meat. We had so many I can't list them all, but suffice to say we ordered as much as we could stomach before rolling out the door.The best part of the counter experience was chatting with the owner who I think appreciated our attempts at Spanish, and as is the way with Spaniards, you make the effort and they'll go that extra mile to help - and that's exactly what happened here. The best, most friendly service we've probably had in Barcelona. I'm glad we stumbled upon this bar after walking out on the touristy 'Royal Tapas' just around the corner.Prices were fair, too, but you need to get in early or loiter around outside for a table.

Other reviews are pretty darn accurate, even many of the points made by those reviewers providing a lower score. It is very small. There are only a few tables for two and the main bar. The whole place has maybe 20 seats.We were worried about finding it. However, it was not a problem at all after checking the location on Google Maps. The cab driver could only drop us on LAs Ramblas and we walked the last two short blocks.While I don't think the food deserves five stars, I do think this small, family run and operated business deserves to be patronized, so I gave it five to keep it near the TA top of list.We had a blast and enjoyed everything we tried…..unusual with my two kids in tow.Important to note they are cash only.Show less",back evening meal great time review pretty darn accurate even many point made reviewer providing lower score small table two main bar whole place maybe 20 seatswe worried finding however problem checking location google map cab driver could drop u la ramblas walked last two short blockswhile dont think food deserves five star think small family run operated business deserves patronized gave five keep near ta top listwe blast enjoyed everything triedunusual two kid towimportant note cash onlyshow le,148,69
20, 2013,8,18,4,Great tapas bar close to flamenco show,"We spent a night on La Rambla and wanted to go to the Show Flamenco Los Tarantos in the Placa Reial just off the La Rambla. The Placa is just about half way down to the left if heading south on La Rambla. We wanted to keep everything as simple and convenient as possible. So we purchased our tickets for the Flamenco Show on the internet for 8 euros per/person. It is 10 euro at the show We went to the 8:30 pm show. The show only lasts about 45 minutes but gives you the flavor of the dance. I highly recommend buying the tickets ahead of time because when we got to the show location there was about 10 people in line but when they opened the doors at 8:00 pm they asked if anyone in line had tickets and we went right in and had first choice of a seat for the show. We had dinner before the show at Bodega Biarritz 1881 and the choices of the tapas were varied and tasty. The Bodega Biarritz is just off the Placa Reial. It is only a minute away from the Show Flamenco Los Tarantos which is in the Placa Reial.Also, if you want low cost drinks after the show there is an Irish pub just off the north side of the Placa Reial. Local beer was only 1.75 euros and a glass off wine was 2.75 euros. We paid 25 euros for a large beer and glass of wine on La Rambla earlier in the day.

It is a wonderful little family run place that is exactly the sort of place you would hope to find in the City (and are largely absent from the centre of london)It was a bit hard to find initially, however when we did we were offered a warm welcome and got a seat immediately. We did go early by Spanish standards (around 8:30) and while it did get busy, people did not generally wait long for a seat.All of the food is laid out on a long bench, where there are seats and there are also tables and seats around the outside. The food all looks great, then you go and select what you want along with some items on a menu and it is then cooked and brought to you. Everything that we had was delicious and the only problem was that I was too full to eat everything I wanted. You can see everything being cooked as the kitchen is open, and often the food is brought by the chef.The staff were really helpful and friendly and they all appeared to be family as they were even posing for photos at the request of some diners.Only issue was that the beer (Estrella) was more expensive than usual at 5 euros a pint, although the food is all reasonable, as were other drinks.Definitely worth a visit!Show less",went finding trip advisor pleased wonderful little family run place exactly sort place would hope find city largely absent centre londonit bit hard find initially however offered warm welcome got seat immediately go early spanish standard around 830 get busy people generally wait long seatall food laid long bench seat also table seat around outside food look great go select want along item menu cooked brought everything delicious problem full eat everything wanted see everything cooked kitchen open often food brought chefthe staff really helpful friendly appeared family even posing photo request dinersonly issue beer estrella expensive usual 5 euro pint although food reasonable drinksdefinitely worth visitshow le,243,132

We both ate and ate til we could eat no more! Everything was so tasty and the whole setup felt very authentically Spanish - unlike a lot of other tapas bars in the area. I would recommend Bodega without hesitation for a delicious and atmospheric meal! You come away feeling you've had a real taste of Spain. The staff were also very friendly and helpful. The only negative I could mention is that the pricing is not exactly made clear, although this is only a problem if your eyes are bigger than you belly, like us! We just kept ordering more!

This place has no menu the food is cooked and presented in front of you which the friendly staff can explain or advice..the food is then represented with garnishes etc, the wine is fantastic and extremely well priced, we are visiting for ten day and have been now to several restaurants but have decided to return here for our last also!

A homemade spicy tomato broth over freshly fried potato pieces and a little drizzle of mayo. The way they're intended to be. EVERY item we had was fresh, hot, well made and incredibly tasty.

There is no set menu just loads of superb tapas laid out along the bar and ready to be warmed up / cooked as you require. The staff were charming, friendly and helpful - a really nice touch was the waiter filling our (white) wine glasses with ice to cool them before giving them to us.

98, 2014,7,24,4,Tricky to find but TASTY!,"Decided to have my last meal in Barcelona here based on TA reviews; did not disappoint! Bit tricky to find, even using the ""point me there"" feature of my TA app map but only because of the rabbit warren designed neighborhood off Las Ramblas. It it SMALL, we got the last ""table"" which was a barrel with two chairs, but it was right next to the AC unit which was greatly appreciated as it was 84F at 9pm.It's true, no menu but everything is on display on the bar. There were 4 people working but they have a system, one man, who speaks fluent English seats you & handles drinks & will explain the system (as in no menu, cash only, Tapas are no less than 1.75 but no more than 4 Euro per piece, etc.), the other 2 men clear dishes & produce clean dishes. The woman behind the bar is in charge of the Tapas, she speaks at least 3 languages fluently; she explained ingredients to me in English (even noting I cannot have this it is fish; I told the waiter I'm allergic to shellfish, he passed on the word, impressive, even if slightly incorrect!) When I returned to order a couple more pieces she was explaining the lot to a French family, en Francais, so I ordered my next bit en Francais & the rest of the evening was en Francais; she's also fluent in Spanish. Nothing they had that night had shellfish so we tried an assortment of the traditional Tapas. I believe their definition of tradition is pork & cheese - NOT a problem. The flavors were divine! Just go! They have a little velvet rope they pull across the door frame when they are full & they never answer the phone & don't take reservations; so just go & wait it out. (We waited a whole 4 minutes but in fairness somebody was walking out the door when we arrived, so well timed on our part) I'd say they can seat maybe 20 people at one time. 2 drinks & 10 pieces of Tapas was 42 Euros.I want to add that there was a family of 5 & a family of 4 (2 parents w/children all under the age of 13) all sat at the bar & seemed to enjoy themselves but logistically I had to give average ratings for large groups & business meals because it would just be physically impossible unless you were to rent out the whole place for your party of 20.If I wasn't leaving in the morning I'd go back!

The chef/owner was very friendly and makes one of the best Bombas I've had. All the food was very flavoursome and some tapas had a touch of French flair due to his wife being French.

133, 2014,9,13,4,Excellent Tapas,True to other reviews this was an excellent experience. The restaurant is small with only a few table s seating at most 2 people against the wall. Most use the bar to eat from and make their tapas selection. The variety of tapas was one of the best I have seen and everything was perfectly cooked. Service was faultless. You cannot book and if you want to avoid queues then it is important to arrive fairly early ie before 7pm.The only possible criticism would be that the flavours of tapas were perhaps slightly bland relative to some of the best I have had. Nevertheless there were plenty of original combinations not found in the more ordinary restaurants in the town.

Also several of the choices were just minor variations on the same theme.. i.e. meatballs, chicken, or pork skewers all with the same sauce.

What an experience it was!Bodega Biarritz 1881 is in one of the exits of Placa Reial, on the Carrer del Vidre. And Placa Reial is aside the La Rambla. We got down at the Catalunya metro station and took a nice long walk through La Rambla to reach the place.Bodega Biarritz has a classic bodega look & feel. A cozy, nice little place which can seat a maximum of 20 - 25 people at the maximum at a time. We were three including our little son 4 years old. And we were lucky to be at the door around 7pm and were offered seats right away. Lucky because it took another 45 minutes or so before the first couple were let in from the queue that built up after us!Three gentlemen who were serving made it a very 'welcoming' and cozy experience for us. Each of them strived to make us feel comfortable and we felt we were taken good care of! And it was not easy with at least two dozen different dishes on the offer and a stream of orders coming in from each person in the restaurant! I wonder how can people be so professional, warm, effective and smiling at the same time!We tried as many dishes as we could and still did not cover it all. But each dish tasted great. And were served in such a way that we had them warm and there was not a moment of 'sitting & waiting'. Great food and lovely service!This is not the right place if you are taking a business guest out or if you are looking for a candle light dinner. Neither the right place for large groups who want to be served on a single table. But perfect place if your focus is great tapas, relaxed environment and good drinks.We loved our experience.

Best decision ever. The place is rather small, but that's what attracted me as it looked so cozy and unpretentious from outside. You have to queue for seats, but it's not a problem at all as one of the staff (I don't know his name but he serves drinks and attends to queuing customers), and boy does he know how to handle waiting customers. He intentionally makes drinks skillfully as a ""show"", and even pokes fun at waiting customers, which is actually a brilliant move as it makes the wait more entertaining.Once you get seated, you are explained how the ordering works. I love the system. You order when it's your turn, and you ""pick and choose"" the food you want, with the most patient lady ever explaining to you what each dish is (even if you don't ask about it). Once you've selected the dish, they put the dish in the oven and make the dish even better than what was presented. They even add sauces and extra ingredients (at no charge). And of course, the food was absolutely delicious. The drinks were fantastic too. In fact, I appreciate how the sangria was made stronger than most others I've tried (I know this cos I tend to drink them fast, in light of the hot weather, and I actually felt light headed from the one they served).Once you finish your meal, the lady asks you if everything is ok, and makes you feel well taken care of. Even the chef serves you with a smile although his hands are always busy with the food. And finally, you get a sincere handshake from the gentleman who attends to the queuing customers.I left the place with a huge smile and a filled stomach.

It becomes very easy to see why- nice Sangria, reasonable prices and food adorning the counter like some incredible, edible house decoration.The sheer range of food is excellent; from courgettes with ricotta to chicken skewers to stacks of chorizo and potatoes, you're guaranteed to find something that everyone will like. The people who work there are as warm as the top of the counter you're seated at, friendly and happy to give any of their personal recommendations.With this in mind, I come to the one drawback of the place. First, how cramped everything is. Others might call it 'cosy', and there is something nice about rubbing shoulders with visitors and locals alike, I have to admit. But when you're hanging off the counter and you look like you're performing surgery when eating, you know something is a little off.But if that doesn't bother you, then it's definitely worth a try. Between four of us, having ordered 17 tapas, 5 cocktails and 2 beers, the price came to just over 90 euros, which we thought was pretty reasonable.

They are made of mainly cheese, tomatoes, potatoes. Nothing special about either the taste or the ingredients. The main meat tapas are grilled chicken stew, chilli pork skew and sausage.There are about 20 choices, the most majority of them are actually €4 pounds, although it says tapas prices from €1.5 to €4. A small bottle of water (€0.27 in supermarket) charged €2.5, ridiculous!!For two of us plus 3 year old spent €52, really came as a shock.We compared this with a proper dinner at a decent restaurant at port side the previous night, which cost the same. But for that one, we had all seafood, including two large seafood dishes, one large portion of starter and 3 teas. In case you wonder, it is ELX, Maremagnum shopping centre local 9.So we honestly think Bodega Biarritz is overpriced place with nothing special.

Also a girl left and gave us the thumbs up and told us to carry on waiting. It wasn't long that we were seated on 2 stools at the end of the bar (All the seating is on wooden bar stools and along the high bar and on small crescent shaped tables- therefore it makes it difficult to eat together if you are any more than a couple in a group)We were left on our own for abit to marvel over the delights that sat before us on the bar.. I took a walk up and down the bar to look at the wonderful food. The concept is that you basically tell the waiter what you want, and they pick it up, pop it on a plate and heat it up in a mini oven for you, Don't be fooled that the food isn't enough to fill you. I think we ended up having about 12 things between us:highlights for me were the ham croquettes -wasn't keen on the cod ones, but all the others were lovely.A tomato based round tart, goats cheese on a rosti, chorizo sausage.

We were encouraged to try the 8 tapas selection plates and were told that it would be €35 for the food and our two glasses of sangria.

There are 2 other parties behind of us in line, one of the staff asked everyone if they do not mind to stand outside of the restaurant and eat/ drink. The third party said they do not mind, they have ordered their drinks, then a table became free, another staff came and asked them if they want to come in or stay outside, of course they said they want to come inside. Myself and the second party asked what is going on? We are here before them and they have been offered the table before us? The staff told us some really lame excuses, she said in Spain it is illegal to serve food and drinks on the outside! I was thinking why did you offer them in the place? Not impressed, we complained, all the people inside were watching us. So the manager apologised and said he did not know. We got offered a free drink as a gesture of sorry. We did not expect anything, but it is nice for them to acknowledge the mistake and they have been apologising to us and the food is nice. If they could communicate better, I would give 5 stars.This place is quite small and you can not book in advance. You have to queue for a place.

680, 2016,8,8,5,Definitely must try,"The food is 5 stars. There is no technical menu but no fear. Some offerings are writing on the wall and you also get out of your seat and say yes or no to each menu item as your waitress points them out and explains them from the other side of the counter. The items are then staggered out so you can eat and have new items brought out every few minutes. It was a unique experience and the place is very lively. If you're coming with more than 1 other person, be prepared to separate. It's tiny and getting more than 2 seats together is hard. We got lucky and had 2 tables back to back which was nice since our other travel companions were our children. The wine and cocktails were good too. Fast service since they need to re-seat so if you want to a place to linger, this isn't the place for you.I took off one star for the cramp seats. We probably had the worst table in the restaurant though and others would probably be fine. My kids had a nice table. Our table consisted of 2 stools and a table about 8 inches wide by 15 inches long. Basically a legal size piece of paper. A fan was running close to my head so I had to switch seats with my husband because the waitress worried about my hair getting caught. My husband happily hunched over and sat. They could make some tables slightly bigger since there are bigger tables in the same aisle space and the fans could be replaced with something better and better located.Tip: the line seems to go faster than their sign states so don't jump ship too fast.

It opens only for dinner at 5:30pm and is located in the Gothic Quarter of Barcelona and it is hard to find. It would be harder in the dark. It is in a narrow lane off the large market square - back right if entering from La Rambla. We arrived at 7:30 and it was the only restaurant in the area with a queue. The notice boards give a hint - no seafood, cash only. We waited 30 minutes but the friendly staff offered us drinks to fill the time. It is best to sit at the bar to watch the action. There are no menus - the choice of tapas is laid out on the bench and this changes daily. Chef recommends 8 dishes for a couple - 20 Euro p/p. You walk up and down to select - being our first time we left it to him. I would choose your own. It all arrived on a large serving plate within 10 minutes. This style of tapas is not my choice - Hi Carb - lots of potato/cheese/sausage but other patrons were really enjoying themselves.

Topped with cheese. Chorizo sandwich? Topped with cheese. If you like cheese you'll likely love it. If you don't like cheese you should probably stay away.

If we went again we wouldn't do the 8 Tapas deal - we would choose the first 4 (a tortilla, a vegetable stack with eggplant etc, a quiche, 1 pastry/chorizo Tapas). The next 4 were all too similar & heavy on pastry/cheese in our opinion although some may love that? However, a very pleasant night so we would recommend a visit.

Not much selection here tho, only one available.Overall we felt that the whole experience was rushed & that we were being pushed through in order to get more people in.

756, 2016,10,4,4,Authentic Spanish tapas! Great experience,"We visited on a weekend. We were aware we may have to wait but were prepared for this. Although we were in luck!We chose a stool at the bar the process was explained. We were able to choose the ""recommended"" plate or choose your own. I am fussy and don't eat fish so we selected our own.The tapas was well presented and everything looked amazing! All big portions for tapas which was great allowing me and my husband to half most things to taste more.There was a good selection of meat tapas as well as vegetable tapas. Drinks were also good (including sangria).It is difficult to recommend specific items as it was all beautiful. After choosing you plate is warmed up and items brought when ready (things at different times so things stay warm).This was the best meal we had in Barcelona as the food was lovely and the atmosphere was also nice. The decor was traditional Spanish which all added to the wonderful experience.Defiantly worth a visit (or two) if you are in the area.Show less",visited weekend aware may wait prepared although luckwe chose stool bar process explained able choose recommended plate choose fussy dont eat fish selected ownthe tapa well presented everything looked amazing big portion tapa great allowing husband half thing taste morethere good selection meat tapa well vegetable tapa drink also good including sangriait difficult recommend specific item beautiful choosing plate warmed item brought ready thing different time thing stay warmthis best meal barcelona food lovely atmosphere also nice decor traditional spanish added wonderful experiencedefiantly worth visit two areashow le,177,87

758, 2016,10,4,5,Tasty food in a cosy setting,"We visited Bodega just 10 days ago, and had a lovely meal with very tasty tapas.After a lovely sunny Sunday, the skies opened and we had to queue in the rain for about 20 minutes. We could have left, of course, but it all kind of added to the charm of this small blink-and-you'll-miss-it establishment found down a cobbled alleyway! And we had a glass of wine to warm our souls and keep us happy whilst we waited for the next table to become free - perfect! But we weren't the only ones queuing - 2 couples in front of us, and by the time we were seated, another 10 people outside!We sat on one of their barrel tables, small but charming, and which added to the overall atmosphere of the place.Tapas were very tasty, but very heavy on cheese & bread selections. They make this clear before you you even enter the restaurant (on an amusing blackboard to warn any coeliacs, dairy-intolerants etc), but even so, we were still hoping for a greater selection of meat and fish tapas that weren't encased in cheesy tortilla or bread. We ended up ordering an additional chorizo plate, just to counter all the carbs we'd been faced with (any excuse!)It was constantly busy, and we're glad we went here and experienced it. But strangely, for value & choice, it fell towards the bottom of our list by the time we'd left Barcelona (due in part to finding so many other lovely restaurants with amazing food)We'd certainly return, as the atmosphere was great, the food was good, and the experience was good fun all round - but might opt for just drinks and a light snack next time :)Show less",visited bodega 10 day ago lovely meal tasty tapasafter lovely sunny sunday sky opened queue rain 20 minute could left course kind added charm small blinkandyoullmissit establishment found cobbled alleyway glass wine warm soul keep u happy whilst waited next table become free perfect werent one queuing 2 couple front u time seated another 10 people outsidewe sat one barrel table small charming added overall atmosphere placetapas tasty heavy cheese bread selection make clear even enter restaurant amusing blackboard warn coeliacs dairyintolerants etc even still hoping greater selection meat fish tapa werent encased cheesy tortilla bread ended ordering additional chorizo plate counter carbs wed faced excuseit constantly busy glad went experienced strangely value choice fell towards bottom list time wed left barcelona due part finding many lovely restaurant amazing foodwed certainly return atmosphere great food good experience good fun round might opt drink light snack next time show le,287,130

Really good presentation of the food, everything was made of fresh products and the food was warmed up. Perfect! As for the drinks, the mojitos were very good, the sangria was so-so. The owner speaks french, et il ne parle pas comme une vache espagnole comme dirait sa femme. The only thing to improve would be not to rush people to eat. And we felt a little bit narrow as it is a very small place. Not good for groups or for children. As for the prices, tapas are between 1.5€ and 4€ if I am not mistaken and it totally worth it.

817, 2017,1,13,4,An accidental find,"A late afternoon walk around the gothic quarter of Barcelona, I fell upon this little gem. Little being a good word to describe this small tapas bar as it must only have about 20 seats but I was lucky to find it as it was opening and it was empty. The bar has two rules, firstly it does not accept cards so it is cash only and secondly, they will only serve you a drink if you order food.So let's talk about the food.... the bar top is covered in plates of various dishes (Think of Basque Bars!). The owner and staff (especially the French waitress, Orlane who speaks perfect English and if very friendly) are passionate about the food and explain they open at 5pm because they spend the previous 7 hours cooking the food. The food is in one word, wonderful. Now the shock horror... you pick the food to be warmed up and rather then being nuked in a microwave it is warmed up the old fashion way in the oven. Dishes are served as the get to temperature which spreads out the time giving you more chance to drink. The dishes are served and garnished as if they are a course of a tasting menu in a top restaurant. Ingredients are fresh and meat is moist. Tortilla with pesto is fresh and the chicken stacked with numerous vegetables filling.On the Saturday night I had this fantastic idea of a revisit but unfortunately the queue outside confirmed the popularity of the bar and I had to dine elsewhere. If you can find the place and the queue isn't very long, this is a good place to try.Show less",late afternoon walk around gothic quarter barcelona fell upon little gem little good word describe small tapa bar must 20 seat lucky find opening empty bar two rule firstly accept card cash secondly serve drink order foodso let talk food bar top covered plate various dish think basque bar owner staff especially french waitress orlane speaks perfect english friendly passionate food explain open 5pm spend previous 7 hour cooking food food one word wonderful shock horror pick food warmed rather nuked microwave warmed old fashion way oven dish served get temperature spread time giving chance drink dish served garnished course tasting menu top restaurant ingredient fresh meat moist tortilla pesto fresh chicken stacked numerous vegetable fillingon saturday night fantastic idea revisit unfortunately queue outside confirmed popularity bar dine elsewhere find place queue isnt long good place tryshow le,281,144

Ordered a second drink halfway through the meal and it never came - they did take it off the bill at the end when I asked though, and the servers were generally friendly.

You simply select as many as you want (the waiter explains what's what) and then it's brought to your seat - try and get one by the bar if you can as it just adds to the experience.

You certainly do not need a menu at Bodega Biarritz as the long bar (spanning the length of the bistro) is covered with mouthwatering, mounded platters of gorgeous Tapas. You simply point and eat. On our visit, we elected to allow our sever to make sections for us which included sausages, zucchini eggplant cheese stacks, chorizo stuffed potatoes, roasted chicken skewers, Iberico Ham pastry melts, Lamb Meatballs, etc,). Each and every dish was a wonderful taste adventure. Simply delicious. We washed it all down with house made sangria (which, actually, was some of the best sangria we tasted while in Spain). We really wanted to return and try other sections on a different day but there was a huge 1 1/2 hour wait (the place is charming but very tiny).

On the menu it offers the staff to explain each of the tapas that are available. But when the waiter explained them, the descriptions and run down of the tapas was extremely brief and barely described the tapas. For example he would just point to a dish and say ""mushroom and garlic"" or ""tomato"" to explain the flavour of the dish but did not actually explain what the dish was. So we still don't know what we actually ate, although it tasted good and seemed to involve some kind of goat cheese mixed with tomato on a crust of some kind??Picking the tapas was also very rushed and we felt like we had no time to think about what we wanted and without actually knowing what the dishes were we Just pointed to 3 dishes that looked good. This process of selecting our food ruined the experience for me and while the food was quite good I did not enjoy the experience as a result. We also had sangria and a mojito which were not that great.Overall good food, poor seating and rushed service.Show less",came quick bite seated bar area stool uncomfortable cramped space menu offer staff explain tapa available waiter explained description run tapa extremely brief barely described tapa example would point dish say mushroom garlic tomato explain flavour dish actually explain dish still dont know actually ate although tasted good seemed involve kind goat cheese mixed tomato crust kindpicking tapa also rushed felt like time think wanted without actually knowing dish pointed 3 dish looked good process selecting food ruined experience food quite good enjoy experience result also sangria mojito greatoverall good food poor seating rushed serviceshow le,206,109

I'd definitely recommend going here if you're on a couples city break, I don't think it'd be ideal for a larger group of people as it is really very small.

A sister restaurant has opened about 100m further down the road so it's worth checking waiting times at both.The staff are friendly and welcoming which is nice to see in such a busy place. Each tapas is priced between €1.50 and €4.00 and drinks are reasonably priced too.The place has about 35 different options all of which are prepared and displayed on the counter. You can choose a surprise menu 1 or 2 where they will pick for you or simply pick the dishes you want after the chef has explained each one. A word of warning here, the tapas you choose will be picked from the dishes on display and re-heated with some additional sauces and garnishes added.In terms of taste, I can't really complain as each dish was packed with flavour. However, I felt a little disappointed that a lot of the dishes were similar in construction and generally consisted of variations of Spanish tortilla, stacked vegi's with cheese, meat skewers and potato croquettes. You will not find any seafood here as it's not their specialty.Overall, it's probably better than the tourist traps on la Rambla and the surrounding squares (although all the people in the restaurant were tourists) but I would try somewhere else next time.Show less",place received great review surprise busy however restaurant small 20 seat queue sister restaurant opened 100m road worth checking waiting time boththe staff friendly welcoming nice see busy place tapa priced 150 400 drink reasonably priced toothe place 35 different option prepared displayed counter choose surprise menu 1 2 pick simply pick dish want chef explained one word warning tapa choose picked dish display reheated additional sauce garnish addedin term taste cant really complain dish packed flavour however felt little disappointed lot dish similar construction generally consisted variation spanish tortilla stacked vegis cheese meat skewer potato croquette find seafood specialtyoverall probably better tourist trap la rambla surrounding square although people restaurant tourist would try somewhere else next timeshow le,242,122

This doesn't take from the experience - we loved the lively atmosphere.Our stay in Barcelona was too short to comment on other reviewers' opinion that this is the best tapas in the city, but it's definitely worth including on your itinerary for good value, tasty tapas in a bouncing venue.Show less",took online advice go early 530pm walked last table two within 40 min queue door able move food counter soon best place choose food staff great explain everything waswe went first 8 tapa 27 euro topped couple tapa finish first batch enough appetite didnt want leave without sampling couple looked enticingthe place rule cant drink bar food fair enough buzzing spot popular keep customer rolling doesnt take experience loved lively atmosphereour stay barcelona short comment reviewer opinion best tapa city definitely worth including itinerary good value tasty tapa bouncing venueshow le,181,87

Dishes are served in specific order, so at the beginning I felt it was too much meat at once.Despite this, everything is very smart prepared, very balanced.

This was the #2 rated tapas joint on trip advisor at the time so my wife and I went to check it out. I've never had tapas before but if this is what traditional tapas is, it's really just a modified version of typical American bar snacks/appies except on skewers and/or small-ish portions. Everything seemed kind of greasy, cheese-y and heavy. They had cheeseburger (without the bun), chicken wings on a skewer, chicken breast on a skewer with various sauces drizzled on top, potatoes with cheese, sausages on a skewer, etc. You can see how it looks in all the photos. There was also no seafood option. Maybe my food expectations are skewed because I live in Vancouver where there are 1000's of healthy tasty well-executed food options.Also ate at the #1 rated tapas place at the time of my visit which is just across the street.Show less",barcelona mid june 2017 trip 2 rated tapa joint trip advisor time wife went check ive never tapa traditional tapa really modified version typical american bar snacksappies except skewer andor smallish portion everything seemed kind greasy cheesey heavy cheeseburger without bun chicken wing skewer chicken breast skewer various sauce drizzled top potato cheese sausage skewer etc see look photo also seafood option maybe food expectation skewed live vancouver 1000 healthy tasty wellexecuted food optionsalso ate 1 rated tapa place time visit across streetshow le,157,71

1019, 2017,8,21,5,"""Good tapas but a good concept for tourist trap","We ate in this restaurant few days ago. First of all, you have to wait at least more than 30 minutes because the restaurant room is extremely small. A French waitress comes to you to ask you what do you want to drink (sly because you have to stay after you took your drink). Don't taste the mojito here, unfortunately it's the worst mojito I ever drunk in Spain ! If you want to try good places for cocktails, prefer go to the Ocaña, The Paradiso or ""El Jardí"". Then, when you took place in the restaurant, we give you a very approximative menu with only two different choices and in each we choose your food for you, I'm sorry but when you have specials needs, it can be complicated ! So, if you don't want to choose one of the menus, you can also serve you tapa after tapa and here again you have a surprise : you know that prices are somewhere between EUR 1,50 and EUR 4 per tapa but you have to ask prices, it doesn't appear on the menu ! Not easy to manage your budget ! Finally, it was good but not the best tapas of BCN, the service is good but the waitress is condescending especially when you give her your opinion on the restaurant, prices are not appear clearly. If you want to drink only, do not go here because you have to eat in order to drink something. Too much conditions for this tourist trap ! I don't recommend this place, we spent a bad moment here.Show less",ate restaurant day ago first wait least 30 minute restaurant room extremely small french waitress come ask want drink sly stay took drink dont taste mojito unfortunately worst mojito ever drunk spain want try good place cocktail prefer go ocaña paradiso el jardí took place restaurant give approximative menu two different choice choose food im sorry special need complicated dont want choose one menu also serve tapa tapa surprise know price somewhere eur 150 eur 4 per tapa ask price doesnt appear menu easy manage budget finally good best tapa bcn service good waitress condescending especially give opinion restaurant price appear clearly want drink go eat order drink something much condition tourist trap dont recommend place spent bad moment hereshow le,267,138

At first I was unsure - the restaurant was tiny - yet, once we were seated I realised this only added to its charm! With just a few tables for two along the side and then seating a long the bar it was a bit of a squeeze - but this most definitely added to the atmosphere of the place, along with the low lighting & dark wood interior.The waitress introduced us to the menu, with options to either get a 'surprise' platter, or to pick ourselves from the array of tapas lining the bar. We decided to pick our own - and Nicholas our waiter was happy to talk us through each dish so we could select what we wanted to try (they vary from around €2-5 each)! We ended up with around 8 different tapas, which we were warmed & served to us at the bar, we opted for Sangria too! Everything was delicious and surprisingly filling! The staff were warm & welcoming, especially Nicholas & Kareen who were keen to chat :) (Salamat!)Overall a lovely experience, good food, atmosphere, pleasant staff and very reasonably priced (our bill was around €32 for two with sangria!) - Would definitely recommend to others & hope to visit again if we're ever back in Barcelona! ❤️Show less",stumbled across place whilst walking around gothic quarter first night barcelona search authentic tapa checking menu around main street boyfriend started looking nearby place rating phone discovered bodega biarritzluckily got queue started forming around 530pm first unsure restaurant tiny yet seated realised added charm table two along side seating long bar bit squeeze definitely added atmosphere place along low lighting dark wood interiorthe waitress introduced u menu option either get surprise platter pick array tapa lining bar decided pick nicholas waiter happy talk u dish could select wanted try vary around 25 ended around 8 different tapa warmed served u bar opted sangria everything delicious surprisingly filling staff warm welcoming especially nicholas kareen keen chat salamatoverall lovely experience good food atmosphere pleasant staff reasonably priced bill around 32 two sangria would definitely recommend others hope visit ever back barcelona show le,279,121

1075, 2017,9,5,4,Amazing Experience and Tapas!,"What can I say about this place, one of the best meals I've ever had!My wife and I visited here on our last night in Barcelona after seeing it mentioned online earlier in the day. After walking down an alleyway leading from Plaça Reial we came across a small queue that we soon realised was for the restaurant. At the end of the queue was a sign saying there would be around an hour wait from this point. We were quickly greeted by a member of staff however who said the wait may not be that long and we could have a drink whilst we waited. Seeing how busy everywhere else was and being keen to try the restaurant we decided to wait.While in the queue I tried to have a little look inside to see what we could be expecting. I was surprised to see that the restaurant only had around 18-20 seats, most of which were at the bar with tables for two along the wall. Easy to see why there was a queue. But if you're looking for amazing tapas and an authentic evening in Barcelona it's well worth the wait.When we went in to the restaurant (the queue time was actually about 30 minutes) we were sat pretty much smack in the middle of the bar, which was covered with more tapas dishes that I could care to count but all of which I wanted to eat. The restaurant allows you to order individual plates but the vast majority seemed to go with the two menu options. Option One was eight tapas dishes for €27 and Option Two was €39 and consisted of Pan con Tomate followed by cheese and some incredible Iberico ham and then your eight tapas dishes. After choosing Option Two a member of staff spoke with us to find out what foods, flavours, etc. we liked and then put together the eight dishes they thought we would like by warming through the food on the bar. If you don't like something they're more than happy to change it for you, we also added a chorizo plate to our dinner.The quality and taste of the food was absolutely first class and rivals anything I've eaten in London, New York, San Francisco, etc. I have no doubt when we return to Barcelona we will be spending our first night Bodega Biarritz 1881. As a final point, the whole staff were outstanding. They literally did not stop all the time we were there but all seemed to be loving what they were doing while making sure every customer was well looked after.

It's hard to believe that we chose the most expensive tapas while two out of the four where the vegetarian options. Staff looked like they wanted us to leave immediately after we ate. A real trap.

It was especially friendly after they found out I am part Filipino. We started with their sangria – very good. Then we let them choose the tapas for us. I think we had 10 tapas total. They were all very rich and filling. The food was simple and comforting, nothing absolutely mind blowing. This is our first ever tapas experience in Spain, so we really didn’t have anything to compare this to. But we thought it was good. I would rate this between average and very good.

She offered to send us to their other location a block away and went there to look and came back because Nicole was so nice to us and felt she would make the experience worth the wait. We were right. On our return back to 1881, we were greeted by the manager who was nice and welcoming, like Nicole. She offered us wine on the street and we waited a few minutes with other patrons who were waiting their turn. Everyone started talking about where they were from: UK, Italy, France, Washington, and New Jersey. Very nice discussion.We got seated 15 minutes later and got waited on by Nicole, the manager, and some great staff. We opted for the staff selection menu and they picked out vegetarian only and some poultry foods (we don’t eat pork or beef). If you don’t like what they pick, just tell them and they bring you out something else without any attitude whatsoever. They just want you to enjoy the meal.Everything was spectacular! Bursting with flavor. We had red wine and then switched to a nice dry Spanish white.I cannot recommend this place enough!

We agreed to eat as the array of tapas laid out over the bar looked pretty good. Nothing is labeled nothing has a price, they hand you a menu that says tapas range between 1 and 6 euros. You have 2 tasting menus to choose from but neither say what is included for the 30 or 40 euros. Although everything looked good it tasted like it was out since lunch, a bunch of reheated croquettes, and small bites that lacked any taste. The sangria tasted like the generic bottled kind you can buy at a carrefour.

Seriously, when the waitress brought over my food, she just mentioned what the meats were (""chicken,"" ""turkey,"" and ""hamburger""), not how they were prepared or seasoned.I should have paid attention to the restaurant's location in a more touristy part of town or even its sign by the door, indicating that by a certain point the line would be an hour long, almost like Disneyland.I must mention that despite the abysmal food, my waiter was very understanding. The restaurant has a policy where if you don't like any or several of your food items, they will replace them for you. Just mere bites in, I told my waiter I was expecting Spanish tapas and was disappointed in the taste, and that rather than get new tapas I wanted to just try another restaurant. He was very understanding and respectful, and allowed me to return my uneaten meal for no charge.Save the airline food for when you're a captive audience on economy class, skip the wait and go try out real tapas somewhere else.Show less",last night barcelona wanted fitting farewell indulging wide array tapa rather immersed barcelona culinary heritage transported back latest transatlantic flight 4 tapa specially curated 3 reminded airline food bland tough meat nuked microwave devoid description seriously waitress brought food mentioned meat chicken turkey hamburger prepared seasonedi paid attention restaurant location touristy part town even sign door indicating certain point line would hour long almost like disneylandi must mention despite abysmal food waiter understanding restaurant policy dont like several food item replace mere bite told waiter expecting spanish tapa disappointed taste rather get new tapa wanted try another restaurant understanding respectful allowed return uneaten meal chargesave airline food youre captive audience economy class skip wait go try real tapa somewhere elseshow le,233,111

I was a bit sceptical about even eating things that have been out on a table for I don't know how long. The menu promises that the waiters will go through with all the choices with you, but no one there explained what the tapas included, so we just picked some of them by random.After choosing the ones you wanted, they heat them all up (which is also weird, I would have loved to have some cold ones too). All of the tapas seemed pretty similar and all of them were really heavy, as we had 3 pieces each and were pretty full afterwards. Also ou might expect from the name that they have a nice selection of wines, but they only have few choices for white and red wine which was disappointing. They do not accept any cards, so remember to take cash with you.Show less",ranking really misleading tapa precooked displayed counter choose one want dont take surprise menu hoax get paying bit sceptical even eating thing table dont know long menu promise waiter go choice one explained tapa included picked randomafter choosing one wanted heat also weird would loved cold one tapa seemed pretty similar really heavy 3 piece pretty full afterwards also ou might expect name nice selection wine choice white red wine disappointing accept card remember take cash youshow le,189,108

Their menu focuses around a ""surprise menu"" (8 tapas for 27-39 euro), where you get 8 tapas of their choosing. However, towards closing time (we went an hour before closing), the surprise menu became a clearance of whatever was leftover, regardless of what dietary preferences you state when they ask.Overall, food was decent, though debatable if worth waiting >30 minutes for in line.

1309, 2018,8,17,4,Great Food and Service,"Went to their first location at 10 PM and there was an hour wait. A server came out to take drink orders while we waited in line. She did tell us their other restaurant was a little bigger and was about a 2 minute straight line walk to get there. We decided to try that option. It was still a 40 minute wait at the other location. That location also had a server taking drink orders in line so at least we had something to quench our thirst while waiting.We decided on the 8 piece, chefs choice for 2 people tapas option for $29E. There is a 10 piece option for $39E which included Iberico ham and Manchego cheese, but we had already tried enough of both at La Boqueria Market that day. I am always hesitant to do the ""chefs choice"" option since usually they are trying to get rid of the items no one is buying. The first two items were OK so I thought maybe it was a bad choice. The next six items were so good it completely changed my mind about our decision. If you do not like any item when they bring it, let them know and they will change it for something else, no questions asked. If you want to view everything available you can walk up to the bar and make your own choices, or look at the menu board on the wall for what is available that day. If you are a seasoned tapas person the menu board could work for you I am not an expert, so would recommend them making the choices for you. They will ask you what types of food you like, spicy, or mild, etc. to get an idea of your preferences.The server, Sherry was available all the time so we never had to wait for anything. She was good at explaining (in English) what we were being served. The service was expedient, but we never felt rushed.

We actually walked by one day, to see a long line up in front, when we then read a sign saying there was another location close by. We walked over to the second location only to see another line up so we thought, this place must be great! We decided we’d go back the next day, and hopefully miss the rush, so that’s exactly what we did.We weren’t quite sure what the restaurant was all about, we just knew it was busy. We actually got lucky and got a seat right away. We happened to miss the rush that started shortly after we sat down. We were pleasantly surprised to see that on the menu, there basically was no menu. The concept was cool - you sit, option to have a starter or not, and you are served a surprise variety of 8 different tapas. There is no fish, only meat and veggies. They ask if you have a preference on which you’d like more and whether or not you like spicey foods. We asked for an even mix of each option, including some spice!!Each tapa they brought out was better than the next. It was quite small inside, but cute and intimate. Even the sangria they served was amazing! One of the best parts of our experience was meeting our server Kareen. The entire staff was lovely; Kareen in particular had such a spontaneous and fun spunk to her which truly made for a great experience. She had a smile the entire time. Once asked where we were from (Toronto) she went ahead and played the new song “In My Feelings” which got the whole restaurant to respond with smiles and laughter. She truly made our experience special! OH, and how could I forget the liquor shots they gave us at the end of the meal, which was on the house. It was literally like drinking a dessert. So good!

1361, 2018,10,14,4,Don't Miss Experience.,"After decades of travel I've come to accept that there seems to exist a general rule which dictates that, when on holiday, one can discover a restaurant with great food at reasonable prices, or one with a wonderful location and an ideal atmosphere, but seldom can you ""have it all"". Well, I can happily tell you that Bodega Biarritz 1881 is the exception to that rule----it does, in fact, ""have it all"". Located in Barcelona's Barri Gotic or old quarter, the walk to the restaurant helps set the mood. Inside the Bodega, one finds a rectangular room where you can be seated at the bar on the left (upon which are displayed the various tapas on offer) or at the small tables on the right (which are half barrels set into the wall), with the setting enhanced by subdued lighting and a lively noise level that still allows for reasonable conversation. The menu is compact in that it allows you to select individual tapas or one of two Chef's Choice options. Even if you go with the Chef's Choice, you still retain some control in that the server will first inquire if you have any allergies or particular dislikes. We chose the more expansive Chef's Choice option and found each tapas presented to be outstanding. Not only were our servers efficient, but they were friendly and fun, explaining each dish and ensuring we were always well taken care of. While Bodega Biarritz 1881 does not offer any seafood or fish dishes, we were very satisfied with every dish we had though I usually restrict my diet to seafood and fish. From the gracious welcome to the complimentary caramel shots that concluded our meal and the wonderful food, service and atmosphere in-between, Bodega Biarritz 1881 is a great experience.Show less",decade travel ive come accept seems exist general rule dictate holiday one discover restaurant great food reasonable price one wonderful location ideal atmosphere seldom well happily tell bodega biarritz 1881 exception ruleit fact located barcelona barri gotic old quarter walk restaurant help set mood inside bodega one find rectangular room seated bar left upon displayed various tapa offer small table right half barrel set wall setting enhanced subdued lighting lively noise level still allows reasonable conversation menu compact allows select individual tapa one two chef choice option even go chef choice still retain control server first inquire allergy particular dislike chose expansive chef choice option found tapa presented outstanding server efficient friendly fun explaining dish ensuring always well taken care bodega biarritz 1881 offer seafood fish dish satisfied every dish though usually restrict diet seafood fish gracious welcome complimentary caramel shot concluded meal wonderful food service atmosphere inbetween bodega biarritz 1881 great experienceshow le,299,137

That's what we found and the tapas is pretty impressive. We opted on the menu for eight tapas for 39 euro which are picked at random and we enjoyed everything that was served to us. At first we were served a selection of meats and cheeses which we initially thought was part of the tapas but we couldn't have been more wrong as two more courses of four tapas arrived after this. If you're a seafood fan, then you might want to try elsewhere as it's stated at the entrance that seafood isn't on the menu.Bodega Biarritz is a wine bar primarily and it was great to soak up the atmosphere.

1398, 2019,3,18,4,INCREDIBLE!,"We went to this place after reading reviews online that sounded absolutely amazing. We were definitely not disappointed. There was a small queue to wait for a table so we were brought drink menus and the drinks were served to us whilst standing outside in the queue (marvellous Sangria). When we went inside it was a very small, quirky and characteristic place, the sort of place from a film, and not an overly large bright tourist trap like some places.Our waitress, Naty, informed us she had only been working there for two weeks, but she was without a doubt a star at her job. We explained to her we both had severe allergies to peanuts and so to make sure none of the tapas brought to us had any nuts on, and she took this seriously and carefully explained each hand selected tapas dish to us in detail once it was served. She was thorough and very chatty, lovely girl!The food was TO DIE FOR. We have been talking about it for the past three days since we visited this place; each tapas that was served to us was absolutely delicious and perfect portion sizes too, we didn’t feel too bloated or full up even after generous helpings.If you want a tapas restaurant off the beaten track that isn’t over priced and overly crowded with tourists then we would highly recommend this; you won’t regret it!

Upon approaching the small, quaint, curtain closed and candle lit entrance you may be welcomed by a slight queue of hungry avid revellers. Do not fear. The wait will not be long and I’m sure you’ll be quickly greeted by a member of the lovely serving staff.. if it is your lucky day, like ours, then you will be greeted by Naty..! A genuinely lovely smile and welcome that would lead you well into any astablishment with open arms. Once again as it was our lucky day .. and said astablishment was the AMAZING Bodega Biarritz!! The venue was highly recommended from a local source living in Barcelona.. and MY BOY(/GIRL) it did not disappoint.. ONE (tapas-y) BIT!With SO much to offer (Don’t take the chalk board menus as gospel as there is a heck of a lot more inside) it can easily be overwhelming for a personal sufferer of DFOI (Drastic-Food-Ordering-Indecisiveness) Do not fear... Once again.. Naty comes to the rescue!! As our party was mixed with vegetarians and meat eaters she kindly offered the best thing to do would be to stick to the set menu. I am usually hesitant to go for this as I like to pick and choose at my own will. And with a vegie present it can sometimes cause conflictions at ordering. HOWEVER.. what a great decision it turned out to be!!! (Thankyou Naty!) We were welcomed with delicious appetisers alongside a thorough explanation and deep ingredient break down of what wonders awaited our taste buds. Needless to say it went down like the first cold IPA on a warm summers day... just leaving us yurning for more!! Once finished, the dishes kept on coming, alongside the smiles, service and explanations.. Each dish somehow topping the last, and despite what appears to be small portions... they are very very filling! This is where the tasting menu was perfect as you are given a real local experts selection of the best the place has to offer.My only complaint from the evening is that I simply ran out of room in my stomach to further consume what other culinary delights awaited to wonder my insides.

This place was very small but very intimate. We sat at the bar at the back of the restaurant and was plenty of space we needed for 2 people. The place was crowded and we felt extremely lucky to get right in (we realized when we left that there was a line / long wait). The tapas were amazing.We selected a menu option where they bring you any 8 tapas that they choose. The instructions were that we would try what they brought us and if there was anything we didn't like, they would swap it out with something else, no questions, only smiles. They first brought 2 very different style/tasting tapas. Both were delicious. Then they asked us which one we preferred. Based on that, they selected the remaining 6. Everything they brought was incredible so we never had to swap anything out. Also, it was extremely filling. At the beginning, I was sure that splitting 8 tapas between the 2 of us wouldn't be enough food but I was struggling at the end.The service was also fantastic! The servers who brought us food were so friendly and fast with any requests we had.And then finally the check... this was by far the lowest cost meal we enjoyed over our 10 day Spanish travels. The cost for the food was so reasonable and the wine was really well priced and extremely tasty. This was such a fun and intimate experience. I wish we could've stayed there longer to enjoy drinks with the staff but unfortunately, once the food is done, they ask customers to go elsewhere to continue drinks so they can serve the waiting line outside.Overall, I highly recommend.Show less",went bodega biarritz last night barcelona wanted enjoy tapa try something different place small intimate sat bar back restaurant plenty space needed 2 people place crowded felt extremely lucky get right realized left line long wait tapa amazingwe selected menu option bring 8 tapa choose instruction would try brought u anything didnt like would swap something else question smile first brought 2 different styletasting tapa delicious asked u one preferred based selected remaining 6 everything brought incredible never swap anything also extremely filling beginning sure splitting 8 tapa 2 u wouldnt enough food struggling endthe service also fantastic server brought u food friendly fast request hadand finally check far lowest cost meal enjoyed 10 day spanish travel cost food reasonable wine really well priced extremely tasty fun intimate experience wish couldve stayed longer enjoy drink staff unfortunately food done ask customer go elsewhere continue drink serve waiting line outsideoverall highly recommendshow le,302,148

So many of the places around Placa Real are completely over-priced and entirely tourist-focussed, but Bodega Biarritz is a hidden gem, and very reasonable. Of course, given its location, it's not going to be some off-the-beaten-track neighbourhood local, but the food and wine are very good, the staff are friendly and helpful, and the vibe is quirky and fun.No reservations, and gets very busy, so go early if you can. If not they serve you wine as you queue, and its usually the catalyst to some interactions with other diners, as are the small tables, the tiny footprint, and the lively atmosphere once in.On this occasion, our server was Mona, who was very engaging, attentive and fun, as well as turning out to share an interesting heritage with my dining companion. It seems most of the staff are Post-Grad University students, so you get a bit of education with your tapas - on this occasion the environmental challenges faced by Leopards and Cheetahs in Iran- I didn't even know there were any... but I do now!

Trinxta is potatoes, eggs, and Iberian ham, while escalivada is a vegetarian dish containing peppers and mushrooms. Soon Jennifer alerted me that a table was free where I can sit and eat more comfortably.

While we waited she took our drinks order and we were able to stand outside in the sun enjoying a glass of Sangria - which is an absolute must, by the way.When we got in to the restaurant (only a 15 minute wait) we were originally sat a small table and then moved over to the bar. This place is definitely designed for only 2 people and it was absolutely tiny, which gives it a real charm. Down the road they do have another restaurant for 2+ guests so you don’t have to miss out if there is more of you.Once seated we decided to go for the 30€ surprise mix. This consisted of 2 appetisers, 8 tapas and a shot of baileys at the end - for this price how could we not. The owner (forgive me I did not catch his name) was fantastic and came over to take our order in a timely fashion. When choosing this specific menu he asked if we ate everything, if there were any allergies, if we liked spice or not, to give him a feel for what we would like. Do bare in mind though they do not offer seafood or fish tapas if that is what you are after.The dishes came up at a nice pace, appetisers first, 2 tapas next and then the other 5 and we didn’t feel rushed at all even though the line of people was getting longer.The food in itself is great and comes from all different regions; Catalonia, Basque Country etc. So you get a real good feel for everything, and we had things we’d never had before.When the bill came we honestly couldn’t believe how cheap it was and what amazing quality everything is.

I recommend it very strongly, especially if you are unfamiliar with Spanish food and could use a guide, or if you have dietary restrictions that mean you need to know what is in a dish ahead of time.Both of our dinners here were excellent, great service and care taken by Oliver and Mona borh. We did the menu option where they select an assortment of tapas for us. I don't eat pork, and both times our waiters were very respectful and diligent in selecting dishes that were ok for me to eat. Mona in particular was very thoughtful in explaining exactly what dishes were what and which things I could eat. If we went back again, now that I am more familiar with the menu options I would want to pick my own (hamburguesa de la casa, Catalan bread, pollo picante...). But it would be a tough call, since the little extras in the fixed menu, the appetizer tortilla de patatas and after-dinner sweet drink, were so nice.I also appreciated that we were able to order drinks while waiting in line.

He gave us a new tapas to try and asked for our thoughts and if it could be improved.You can tell that he loves this place. We can’t wait to come back to visit.This place is so amazing we went twice in our 4 day visit.The staff are extremely friendly and by the end of the meal you feel like you have just eaten at a friends house, they are that friendly.The menu is amazing value for money. There are 2 options.Option 1 is just tapasOption 2 is iberico ham, cheese and tomato bread.You can also just select your own tapas if you like.All of the tapas is on the bar and is all freshly made and cooked to order. There is a total of 24 different tapas to try.The thing we both like about this place is that you can either select your own dishes or have the staff select them for you.If you let the staff select them, they select their favourite dishes and they you tell them which you preferred.The best dish we had was the iberico pork tenderloin. Just superb, so simple but full of flavour.Other dishes we loved were the mash potato, with veggies, topped with cheese and crispy Parma ham (this is like the English bubble and squeak)There was a slightly spicy (just a gentle warmth) egg dish. This had red and green peppers in it but was so light to eat.There are still dishes we would love to try and can’t wait to come back to this place.This restaurant only accepts cash and there maybe a queue as the place only seats about 20 people.

It is very tight for room and we were on a small table against the wall. There are 3 meal options on the menu with 1 and 2 being different options where they pick for you and option 3 being you pick yourself from the tapas which is sat st the bar. We chose option 2. We were asked a few questions about what we liked and then left it up to the staff.We had two appetizers and a board of bread, cheese and ham. All delicious. While waiting for our tapas we were offered a more comfortable table when it had become available and I noticed that happen a couple of times when we were there which I thought was a nice gesture.We were then served our tapas selection all of which we loved but if you dont like something they will happily change it. We finished with a coffee liquor shot which considering I dont usually like that kind of thing was quite nice. On leaving the staff shook our hand, thanked us for coming and were just really friendly and helpful the whole time we were there. One thing to note is they only take cash but we were told this before we went in and there was a sign outside. They also dont do fish or seafood but that is mentioned at the top of the menu.Show less",decided visit based review online werent disappointed went around 1830 waited minute seated tight room small table wall 3 meal option menu 1 2 different option pick option 3 pick tapa sat st bar chose option 2 asked question liked left staffwe two appetizer board bread cheese ham delicious waiting tapa offered comfortable table become available noticed happen couple time thought nice gesturewe served tapa selection loved dont like something happily change finished coffee liquor shot considering dont usually like kind thing quite nice leaving staff shook hand thanked u coming really friendly helpful whole time one thing note take cash told went sign outside also dont fish seafood mentioned top menushow le,260,146

Saved us some money so we could try other places the same night.Very quaint and tight knit restaurant. We arrived around 8 pm and had 3 couples in front of us so we waited with a glass of wine in hand. Great casual date night ambience. Dark with low lighting. The staff is super knowledgeable and friendly, and gave us a tapas-by-tapas explanation of what they are before we chose what we wanted. They are categorized sections.

1740, 2020,1,4,4,"Stunning, hidden gem!","I found this due to looking for the best paella in Barca, however we didnt find this which was advertised. What we did find was an amazing little hidden gem. We was greeted by Oliver who explained how everything worked in the restaurant, he recommended the surprise meat tapas selection. This arrived in stages and was absolutely out of this world, very authentic dishes. We had a 2 x Estrella and 2 x Sangria, my husband said it is the best beer he has had in a long while and he enjoys a nice beer. It came in a frosted glass, which kept it ice cold. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a nice quick bite or a meal with a loved one. The young man on the bar was also really helpful, explaining the dishes in detail so we knew what we was eating. We also asked for no goats cheese and no veg, purely meat tapas for us. Sorry I forgot to take a pic of the last meat one which has the main dishes on, we was just too excited.Show less",found due looking best paella barca however didnt find advertised find amazing little hidden gem greeted oliver explained everything worked restaurant recommended surprise meat tapa selection arrived stage absolutely world authentic dish 2 x estrella 2 x sangria husband said best beer long enjoys nice beer came frosted glass kept ice cold would definitely recommend restaurant nice quick bite meal loved one young man bar also really helpful explaining dish detail knew eating also asked goat cheese veg purely meat tapa u sorry forgot take pic last meat one main dish excitedshow le,185,91

1754, 2020,3,14,4,Best tapas in Barcelona?,"If you’re in Barcelona, you’ll want to try some tapas. If you only have time to try tapas once, go here. We went on our first night of a five day trip and, although we had tapas elsewhere during our stay, this was the best. The premises are small, about 20 covers, and there’s no booking so you just have to turn up early. Fortunately we did. It’s cash only but for 40€ you can have the house selection for two – plentiful plates of delicious food (no fish or seafood) including Iberian ham and warm bread with tomato paste. Details like the warm bread – it’s often cold – mark this place down as the superior experience that it is. Our server, Kate, was delightful and helpful in equal measure. The wine list is short but appropriate. Highly recommended.Show less",youre barcelona youll want try tapa time try tapa go went first night five day trip although tapa elsewhere stay best premise small 20 cover there booking turn early fortunately cash 40 house selection two plentiful plate delicious food fish seafood including iberian ham warm bread tomato paste detail like warm bread often cold mark place superior experience server kate delightful helpful equal measure wine list short appropriate highly recommendedshow le,141,59

This location was able to seat our party of 3 whereas the other had at least a 20+ minute wait. The workers told us it's the same restaurant, just a different location. The food was amazing. We allowed them to select our tapas after they asked us a few questions. We asked for more meat than veggies. The veggie tapas had mushrooms and eggplant which my husband doesn't like so I ended up eating those tapas and they turned out to be really tasty. The meat ones were good, too. The jamon iberico appetizer was really good!! Our server was very attentive and checked in on us just enough.
