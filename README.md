# Guided Project: API and Web Data Scraping

## Overview

For this project I chose to scrap the website of the WSL to find last year's events' results. Then I tried to find an API related to surfing so I could get the length of the waves on the day of each competition and some other information, but I tried with several API's and couldn't get the token. Then I decided to do it with a more simple API and get some climate descriptions (temperature, visibility, and wind) on the day of the competition. I also watched some YouTube videos about API requests to get more information. 

## Deliverables

In the project folder you will find this ReadMe file, a folder named "output" with two CSV files containing the data from web scraping and the API, and the Jupyter Notebook file.
