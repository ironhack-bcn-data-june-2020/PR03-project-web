# Guided Project: API and Web Data Scraping

## Overview

For this project I scrapped https://www.newegg.com/ a web like Amazon for electrodomestics. I did it for all the laptops that they have. resolting in a DataFrame with Brand, model, price and shipping. Then, I tried to find an API related to this and I could not find one. I was trying to find that could tell how many laptops are made and models. At the last moment a could not find any of it and I ended up doing a really random one, about news. 

## Deliverables

In the project you can find the scraping and API files. Both with a DataFrame as an out put.
