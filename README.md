# API and Web Data Scraping


## API 

I used the https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications to get all the data that I will handle during the project part 1.

- I log in with my spotify account
- I extract information from Bon Iver albums
- I collect all songs from the albums and their music features 
- I created a Data Frame to manipulate the information
- I rename the albums according to their album season
- I eliminated duplicates song values
- I saved all the information in a TXT file.


##  Web Data Scraping

I used the YOUTUBE channel on "NPR tiny desk concert" channel to get all KPI data from videos

- I import all libraries
- Construct the headers
- Define the KPIs that I want to get (likes, dislikes, views, etc.)
- I created a Data Frame to manipulate the information
