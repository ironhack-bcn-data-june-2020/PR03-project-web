# API and Web Data Scraping Project

## Project Goal

The goal is to use the API at The Movie Data Base (TMDb.org) to search for Billy Wilder, a prolific-awarded director and scriptwriter and find all his movies in which he worked. TMDb will give as such important facts like the year he started to work in a movie and his filmography. With these data we can start scrapping the website Oscars.org, to find out when he was awarded and in which category. 

### API

First of all, we need to create an account at TMDb.org to get the API key. It's an easy process, quite fast reply by the way. There are two versions for the API, v3 and v4. I chose the v3 in order to find more suport posts to get help.

### Oscars Academy Awards

This is the offcial website released by the Oscars Academy where all the awards since the very beginning of the ceremonies can be found. The search for awards is set up by decades, and each decade, obviously, contains a period of ten years.
