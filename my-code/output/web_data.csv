DART is a planetary defense-driven test of one of the technologies for preventing the Earth impact of a hazardous asteroid: the kinetic impactor. DARTâ€™s primary objective is to demonstrate a kinetic impact on a small asteroid. The binary near-Earth asteroid (65803) Didymos is the target for DART. While Didymosâ€™ primary body is approximately 800 meters across, its secondary body (or â€œmoonletâ€) has a 150-meter size, which is more typical of the size of asteroids that could pose a more common hazard to Earth.
The DART spacecraft will achieve the kinetic impact by deliberately crashing itself into the moonlet at a speed of approximately 6 km/s, with the aid of an onboard camera and sophisticated autonomous navigation software. The collision will change the speed of the moonlet in its orbit around the main body by a fraction of one percent, enough to be measured using telescopes on Earth.",2021-06-01

"Falcon Heavy | Psyche, EscaPADE and Janus","Psyche is a NASA interplanetary mission to visit the main belt asteroid of the same name, 16 Psyche. Spacecraft will take 4 years and one Mars flyby to reach the asteroid, which is of particular interest due to being comprised mostly of iron and nickel. Psyche is theorized to be a remnant of an early planet's core, and may offer insights into how solar system formed and evolved. The mission is led by Arizona State University, with NASA JPL being responsible for mission management and operations. This launch also includes two secondary payloads: Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers (EscaPADE), which will study the Martian atmosphere, and Janus, which will study binary asteroids.",2022-07-01

Proton-M/Briz-M | ExoMars 2022 Kazachok surface platform & Rosalind Franklin rover,"ExoMars 2022 is a second mission of two-part astrobiology project to search for evidence of life on Mars, a joint mission of the European Space Agency and the Russian space agency Roscosmos that consists out of surface module with a rover onboard. The primary objective is to land the rover at a site with high potential for finding well-preserved organic material, particularly from the very early history of the planet. The rover is expected to travel several kilometers during its mission.
The European rover will be the first mission to combine the capability to move across the surface and to study Mars at depth. It will collect samples with a drill down to a depth of 2 m and analyze them with next-generation instruments in an onboard laboratory. Underground samples are more likely to include biomarkers, since the tenuous martian atmosphere offers little protection from radiation and photochemistry at the surface.
While the rover will drive away from the surface platform to perform scientific investigations within several kilometers of the landing site, the Russian-made platform will remain stationary and will investigate the local surface environment for its normal mission lifetime of one Earth year. The main science priorities for the platform are context imaging of the landing site, long-term climate monitoring, and atmospheric investigations. Sensors and instruments will also study the subsurface water distribution at the landing site, investigate the exchange of volatiles between the atmosphere and the surface, monitor the radiation environment and compare it with measurements made with the radiation dosimeter on the Trace Gas Orbiter, and carry out geophysical investigations of the planet's internal structure.",2022-08-01

Ariane 62 | ARIEL & Comet Interceptor,"Atmospheric Remoteâ€sensing Infrared Exoplanet Largeâ€survey mission (ARIEL) is an ESA telescope. During a 4-year mission, ARIEL will observe 1000 planets orbiting distant stars and make the first large-scale survey of the chemistry of exoplanet atmospheres. For a select number of exoplanets, ARIEL will also perform a deep survey of their cloud systems and study seasonal and daily atmospheric variations. ARIEL shares the ride with another ESA mission, Comet Interceptor. It consists of three spacecraft which will be positioned at the Sun-Earth Lagrange point L2, where they will wait for a long-period comet or an interstellar object to come by. Once the desired target appears, the spacecraft will separate and perform a flyby of the target, compiling a detailed 3D profile of a comet.",2028-06-01
